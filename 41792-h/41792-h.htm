1</span>Introduction</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;It was necessary for Thomas Hood still to
do one thing ere the wide circle and profound depth of his genius
were to the full acknowledged: that one thing was&mdash;to
die.&rsquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Douglas Jerrold</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> in the inner circle of
English letters this study of a living writer will need no
apology, it may be well to explain for the general reader the
reasons which moved me to undertake it.</p>
<p>Some time ago a distinguished scholar, the late S. Arthur
Strong, Librarian of the House of Lords, was asked what had been
the chief source of his education.&nbsp; He replied:
&ldquo;Cambridge, scholastically, and Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s
articles in the &lsquo;Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica&rsquo; and
the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; from the purely literary point
of view.&nbsp; I have been a reader of them for many years, and
it would be difficult for me to say what I should have been
without them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Richard Le Gallienne has said that
he bought the &lsquo;Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica&rsquo; simply
to possess one article&mdash;Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s article on
Poetry.&nbsp; There are many other men of letters who would give
similar testimony.&nbsp; With regard to his critical work, Mr.
Swinburne in one of his essays, speaking of the treatise on
Poetry, describes Mr. Watts-Dunton as &lsquo;the first critic of
our time, perhaps the largest-minded and surest-sighted of any
age,&rsquo; <a name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1"
class="citation">[1]</a> a judgment which, according to the
article on Mr. Watts-Dunton in Chambers&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Encyclop&aelig;dia,&rsquo; Rossetti endorsed.&nbsp; In
this same article it is further said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He came to exercise a most important
influence on the art and culture of the day; but although he has
written enough to fill many volumes&mdash;in the
&lsquo;Examiner,&rsquo; <a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo;
(since 1876), the &lsquo;Nineteenth Century,&rsquo; the
&lsquo;Fortnightly Review,&rsquo; etc.&mdash;he has let year
after year go by without his collecting his essays, which, always
dealing with first principles, have ceased to be really
anonymous, and are quoted by the press both in England and in
Germany as his.&nbsp; But, having wrapped up his talents in a
weekly review, he is only ephemerally known to the general
public, except for the sonnets and other poems that, from the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um,&rsquo; etc., have found their way into
anthologies, and for the articles on poetic subjects that he has
contributed to the &lsquo;Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Chambers&rsquo;s Encyclop&aelig;dia,&rsquo; etc.&nbsp; The
chief note of his poetry&mdash;much of it written in
youth&mdash;is its individuality, the source of its inspiration
Nature and himself.&nbsp; For he who of all men has most
influenced his brother poets has himself remained least
influenced by them.&nbsp; So, too, his prose
writings&mdash;literary mainly, but ranging also over folk-lore,
ethnology, and science generally&mdash;are marked as much by
their independence and originality as by their suggestiveness,
harmony, incisive vigour, and depth and breadth of insight.&nbsp;
They have made him a force in literature to which only
Sainte-Beuve, not Jeffrey, is a parallel.&rdquo; <a

<p>These citations from students of Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s
work, written before his theory of the &lsquo;Renascence of
Wonder&rsquo; was exemplified in &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; and
&lsquo;The Coming of Love,&rsquo; show, I think, that this book
would have had a right to exist even if his critical writings had
been collected into volumes; but as this collection has never
been made, and I believe never will be made by the author, I feel
that to do what I am now doing is to render the reading public a
real service.&nbsp; For many <a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>years he has been urged by his friends
to collect his critical articles, but although several men of
letters have offered to relieve him of that task, he has remained
obdurate.</p>
<p>Speaking for myself, I scarcely remember the time when I was
not an eager student of Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s writings.&nbsp;
Like most boys born with the itch for writing, I began to spill
ink on paper in my third lustre.&nbsp; The fermentation of the
soul which drove me to write a dreadful elegy, modelled upon
&lsquo;Lycidas,&rsquo; on the death of an indulgent aunt, also
drove me to welter in drowsy critical journals.&nbsp; By some
humour of chance I stumbled upon the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um,&rsquo; and there I found week by week
writing that made me tingle with the rapture of discovery.&nbsp;
The personal magic of some unknown wizard led me into realms of
gold and kingdoms of romance.&nbsp; I used to count the days till
the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; appeared in my Irish home, and I
spent my scanty pocket money in binding the piled numbers into
ponderous tomes.&nbsp; Well I remember the advent of the old,
white-bearded Ulster book-binder, bearing my precious volumes:
even now I can smell the pungent odour of the damp paste and
glue.&nbsp; In those days I was a solitary bookworm, living far
from London, and I vainly tried to discover the name of the
magician who was carrying me into so &lsquo;many goodly states
and kingdoms.&rsquo;&nbsp; With boyish audacity I wrote to the
editor of the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um,&rsquo; begging him to
disclose the secret; and I am sure my na&iuml;ve appeal provoked
a smile in Took&rsquo;s Court.&nbsp; But although the editor was
dumb, I exulted in the meagre apparition of my initials,
&lsquo;J. D.,&rsquo; under the solemn rubric, &lsquo;To
Correspondents.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was by collating certain signed sonnets and signed articles
with the unsigned critical essays that I at last discovered the
name of my hero, Theodore Watts.&nbsp; Of <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>course, the
sonnets set me sonneteering, and when my execrable imitation of
&lsquo;Australia&rsquo;s Mother&rsquo; was printed in the
&lsquo;Belfast News-Letter&rsquo; I felt like Byron when he woke
up and found himself famous.&nbsp; Afterwards, when I had plunged
into the surf of literary London, I learnt that the writer who
had turned my boyhood into a romantic paradise was well known in
cultivated circles, but quite unknown outside them.</p>
<p>There was, indeed, no account of him in print.&nbsp; It was
not till 1887 that I found a brief but masterly memoir in
&lsquo;Celebrities of the Century.&rsquo;&nbsp; The article
concluded with the statement that in the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; and in the Ninth Edition of the
&lsquo;Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica&rsquo; Mr. Watts-Dunton had
&lsquo;founded a school of criticism which discarded conventional
authority, and sought to test all literary effects by the light
of first principles merely.&rsquo;&nbsp; These words encouraged
me, for they told me that as a boy I had not been wrong in
thinking that I had discovered a master and a guide in
literature.&nbsp; Then came the memoir of Philip Bourke Marston
by the American poetess, Louise Chandler Moulton, in which she
described Mr. Watts-Dunton as &lsquo;a poet whose noble work won
for him the intimate friendship of Rossetti and Browning and Lord
Tennyson, and was the first link in that chain of more than
brotherly love which binds him to Swinburne, his housemate at
present and for many years past.&rsquo;&nbsp; I also came across
Clarence Stedman&rsquo;s remarks upon the opening of &lsquo;The
Coming of Love,&rsquo; &lsquo;Mother Carey&rsquo;s
Chicken,&rsquo; first printed in the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um.&rsquo;&nbsp; He was enthusiastic about the
poet&rsquo;s perception of &lsquo;Nature&rsquo;s grander
aspects,&rsquo; and spoke of his poetry as being &lsquo;quite
independent of any bias derived from the eminent poets with whom
his life has been closely associated.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>When
afterwards I made his acquaintance, our intercourse led to the
formation of a friendship which has deepened my gratitude for the
spiritual and intellectual guidance I have found in his writings
for nearly twenty years.&nbsp; Owing to the popularity of
&lsquo;The Coming of Love&rsquo; and of
&lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo;&mdash;which the late Lord Acton, in
&lsquo;The Annals of Politics and Culture,&rsquo; placed at the
head of the three most important books published in
1898&mdash;Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s name is now familiar to every
fairly educated person.&nbsp; About few men living is there so
much literary curiosity; and this again is a reason for writing a
book about him.</p>
<p>The idea of making an elaborate study of his work, however,
did not come to me until I received an invitation from Dr.
Patrick, the editor of Chambers&rsquo;s &lsquo;Cyclop&aelig;dia
of English Literature,&rsquo; to write for that publication an
article on Mr. Watts-Dunton&mdash;an article which had been
allotted to Professor Strong, but which he had been obliged
through indisposition to abandon at the last moment.&nbsp; I
undertook to do this.&nbsp; But within the limited space at my
command I was able only very briefly to discuss his work as a
poet.&nbsp; Soon afterwards I was invited by my friend, Dr.
Robertson Nicoll, to write a monograph upon Mr. Watts-Dunton for
Messrs. Hodder &amp; Stoughton, and, if I should see my way to do
so, to sound him on the subject.&nbsp; My only difficulty was in
approaching Mr. Watts-Dunton, for I knew how constantly he had
been urged by the press to collect his essays, and how
persistently he had declined to do so.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I
wrote to him, telling him how gladly I should undertake the task,
and how sure I was that the book was called for.&nbsp; His answer
was so characteristic that I must give it here:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Mr.
Douglas</span>,&mdash;It must now be something like fifteen years
since Mr. John Lane, who was then compiling a bibliography of
George Meredith, asked me to consent to his compiling a
bibliography of my articles in the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo;
and elsewhere, and although I emphatically declined to sanction
such a bibliography, he on several occasions did me the honour to
renew his request.&nbsp; I told him, as I have told one or two
other generous friends, that although I had put into these
articles the best criticism and the best thought at my command, I
considered them too formless to have other than an ephemeral
life.&nbsp; I must especially mention the name of Mr. Alfred
Nutt, who for years has been urging me to let him publish a
selection from my critical essays.&nbsp; I am really proud to
record this, because Mr. Nutt is not only an eminent publisher
but an admirable scholar and a man of astonishing
accomplishments.&nbsp; I had for years, let me confess, cherished
the idea that some day I might be able to take my various
expressions of opinion upon literature, especially upon poetry,
and mould them into a coherent and, perhaps, into a harmonious
whole.&nbsp; This alone would have satisfied me.&nbsp; But year
by year the body of critical writing from my pen has grown, and I
felt and feel more and more unequal to the task of grappling with
such a mass.&nbsp; To the last writer of eminence who gratified
me by suggesting a collection of these essays&mdash;Dr. Robertson
Nicoll&mdash;I wrote, and wrote it with entire candour, that in
my opinion the view generally taken of the value of them is too
generous.&nbsp; Still, they are the result of a good deal of
reflection and not a little research, especially those in the
&lsquo;Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica,&rsquo; and I am not so
entirely without literary aspiration as not to regret that, years
ago, when the mass of material was more manageable, <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>I neglected to
collect them and edit them myself.&nbsp; But the impulse to do
this is now gone.&nbsp; Owing to the quite unexpected popularity
of &lsquo;The Coming of Love&rsquo; and of &lsquo;Aylwin,&rsquo;
my mind has been diverted from criticism, and plunged into those
much more fascinating waters of poetry and fiction in which I
used to revel long before.&nbsp; If you really think that a
selection of passages from the articles, and a critical
examination and estimate of the imaginative work would be of
interest to any considerable body of readers, I do not know why I
should withhold my consent.&nbsp; But I confess, judging from
such work of your own as I have seen, I find it difficult to
believe that it is worth your while to enter upon any such
task.</p>
<p>I agree with you that it is difficult to see how you are to
present and expound the principles of criticism advanced in the
&lsquo;Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica,&rsquo; the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um,&rsquo; etc., without discussing those two
imaginative works the writing of which inspired the canons and
generalizations in the critical work&mdash;&lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo;
and &lsquo;The Coming of Love.&rsquo;&nbsp; As regards
&lsquo;Aylwin,&rsquo; however, I cannot help wincing under the
thought that in these days when so much genius is at work in
prose fiction, your discussion will seem to give quite an undue
prominence to a writer who has published but one novel.&nbsp;
This I confess does disturb me somewhat, and I wish you to bear
well in mind this aspect of the matter before you seriously
undertake the book.&nbsp; As to the prose fiction of the present
moment, I constantly stand amazed at its wealth.&nbsp; If,
however, you do touch upon &lsquo;Aylwin,&rsquo; I hope you will
modify those generous&mdash;too generous&mdash;expressions of
yours which, I remember, you printed in a review of the book when
it first appeared.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>After
getting this sanction I set to work, and soon found that my chief
obstacle was the superabundance of material, which would fill
several folio volumes.&nbsp; But although it is undoubtedly
&lsquo;a mighty maze,&rsquo; it is &lsquo;not without a
plan.&rsquo;&nbsp; In a certain sense the vast number of Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s generalizations upon literature, art,
philosophy, and what Emerson calls &lsquo;the conduct of
life,&rsquo; revolve round certain fixed principles which have
guided me in the selection I have made.&nbsp; I also found that
to understand these principles of romantic art, it was necessary
to make a thorough critical study of the romance,
&lsquo;Aylwin,&rsquo; and of the book of poems, &lsquo;The Coming
of Love.&rsquo;&nbsp; I think I have made that study, and that I
have connected the critical system with the imaginative work more
thoroughly than has been done by any other writer, although the
work of Mr. Watts-Dunton, both creative and critical, has been
acutely discussed, not only in England but also in France and in
Italy.</p>
<p>The creative originality of his criticism is as absolute as
that of his poetry and fiction.&nbsp; He poured into his
criticism the intellectual and imaginative force which other men
pour into purely artistic channels, for he made criticism a
vehicle for his humour, his philosophy, and his irony.&nbsp; His
criticisms are the reflections of a lifetime.&nbsp; Their
vitality is not impaired by the impermanence of their
texts.&nbsp; No critic has surpassed his universality of
range.&nbsp; Out of a full intellectual and imaginative life he
has evolved speculations which cut deep not only into the fibre
of modern thought but into the future of human development.&nbsp;
Great teachers have their day and their disciples.&nbsp; Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s day and disciples belong to the young future
whose dawn some of us already descry.&nbsp; For, as Mr. Justin
McCarthy <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>wrote of &lsquo;Aylwin,&rsquo; &lsquo;it is inspired by
the very spirit of youth,&rsquo; and this is why so many of the
younger writers are beginning to accept him as their guide.&nbsp;
Mr. Watts-Dunton has built up a new optimistic philosophy of life
which, I think, is sure to arrest the devastating march of the
pessimists across the history of the soul of man.&nbsp; That is
the aspect of his work which calls for the comprehension of the
new generation.&nbsp; The old cosmogonies are dead; here is the
new cosmogony, the cosmogony in which the impulse of wonder
reasserts its sovereignty, proclaiming anew the nobler religion
of the spiritual imagination, with a faith in Natura Benigna
which no assaults of science can shake.</p>
<p>But, although the main object of this book is to focus, as it
were, the many scattered utterances of Mr. Watts-Dunton in prose
and poetry upon the great subject of the Renascence of Wonder, I
have interspersed here and there essays which do not touch upon
this theme, and also excerpts from those obituary notices of his
friends which formed so fascinating a part of his contributions
to the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um.&rsquo;&nbsp; For, of course, it was
necessary to give the charm of variety to the book.&nbsp;
Rossetti used to say, I believe, that there is one quality
necessary in a poem which very many poets are apt to
ignore&mdash;the quality of being amusing.&nbsp; I have always
thought that there is great truth in this, and I have also
thought that the remark is applicable to prose no less than to
poetry.&nbsp; This is why I have occasionally enlivened these
pages with extracts from his picturesque monographs; indeed, I
have done more than this.&nbsp; Not having known Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s great contemporaries myself, I have looked
about me for the aid of certain others who did know them.&nbsp; I
have not hesitated to collect from various sources such facts and
details connected with Mr. Watts-Dunton <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>and his
friends as are necessarily beyond the scope of my own experience
and knowledge.&nbsp; Among these I must prominently mention one
to whom I have been specially indebted for reminiscences of Mr.
Watts-Dunton and his circle.&nbsp; This is Mr. Thomas St. E.
Hake, eldest son of the &lsquo;parable poet,&rsquo; a gentleman
of much too modest and retiring a disposition, who, from Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s first appearance in London right onwards,
was brought into intimate relations with himself, his relatives,
Rossetti, William Morris, Westland Marston, Philip Bourke
Marston, Madox Brown, George Borrow, Stevenson, Minto, and many
others.&nbsp; I have not only made free use of his articles, but
I have had the greatest aid from him in many other respects, and
it is my bare duty to express my gratitude to him for his
services.&nbsp; I have also to thank the editor of the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; for cordially granting me permission
to quote so freely from its columns; and I take this opportunity
of acknowledging my debt to the many other publications from
which I have drawn materials for this book.</p>

THE RENASCENCE OF WONDER</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The renascence of wonder,&rsquo; to
employ Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s appellation for what he justly
considers the most striking and significant feature in the great
romantic revival which has transformed literature, is proclaimed
by this very appellation not to be the achievement of any one
innovator, but a general reawakening of mankind to a perception
that there were more things in heaven and earth than were dreamt
of in Horatio&rsquo;s philosophy.&rdquo;&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Dr. R. Garnett</span>: Monograph on Coleridge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Undoubtedly</span> the greatest
philosophical generalization of our time is expressed in the four
words, &lsquo;The Renascence of Wonder.&rsquo;&nbsp; They suggest
that great spiritual theory of the universe which, according to
Mr. Watts-Dunton, is bound to follow the wave of materialism that
set in after the publication of Darwin&rsquo;s great book.&nbsp;
This phrase, which I first became familiar with in his
&lsquo;Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica&rsquo; article on Rossetti,
seems really to have been used first in
&lsquo;Aylwin.&rsquo;&nbsp; The story seems originally to have
been called &lsquo;The Renascence of Wonder,&rsquo; but the title
was abandoned because the writer believed that an un-suggestive
name, such as that of the autobiographer, was better from the
practical point of view.&nbsp; For the knowledge of this I am
indebted to Mr. Hake, who says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>&ldquo;During the time that Mr. Swinburne was living in
Great James Street, several of his friends had chambers in the
same street, and among them were my late father, Dr. Gordon
Hake&mdash;Rossetti&rsquo;s friend and physician&mdash;Mr.
Watts-Dunton and myself.&nbsp; Mr. Watts-Dunton, as is well
known, was a brilliant raconteur long before he became famous as
a writer.&nbsp; I have heard him tell scores of stories full of
plot and character that have never appeared in print.&nbsp; On a
certain occasion he was suffering from one of his periodical eye
troubles that had used occasionally to embarrass him.&nbsp; He
had just been telling Mr. Swinburne the plot of a suggested
story, the motive of which was the &lsquo;renascence of wonder in
art and poetry&rsquo; depicting certain well-known
characters.</p>
<p>I offered to act as his amanuensis in writing the story, and
did so, with the occasional aid of my father and brothers.&nbsp;
The story was sent to the late F. W. Robinson, the novelist, then
at the zenith of his vogue, who declared that he &lsquo;saw a
fortune in it,&rsquo; and it was he who advised the author to
send it to Messrs. Hurst &amp; Blackett.&nbsp; As far as I
remember, the time occupied by the work was between five and six
months.&nbsp; When a large portion of it was in type it was read
by many friends,&mdash;among others by the late Madox Brown, who
thought some of the portraits too close, as the characters were
then all living, except one, the character who figures as
Cyril.&nbsp; Although unpublished, it was so well known that an
article upon it appeared in the &lsquo;Liverpool
Mercury.&rsquo;&nbsp; This was more than twenty years
ago.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The important matter before us, however, is not when he first
used this phrase, which has now become a sort of literary
shorthand to express a wide and sweeping idea, but what it
actually imports.&nbsp; Fortunately Mr. Watts-Dunton <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>has quite
lately given us a luminous exposition of what the words do
precisely mean.&nbsp; Last year he wrote for that invaluable
work, Chambers&rsquo;s &lsquo;Cyclop&aelig;dia of English
Literature,&rsquo; the Introduction to volume iii., and no one
can any longer say that there is any ambiguity in this now famous
phrase:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As the storm-wind is the cause and not the
effect of the mighty billows at sea, so the movement in question
was the cause and not the effect of the French Revolution.&nbsp;
It was nothing less than a great revived movement of the soul of
man, after a long period of prosaic acceptance in all things,
including literature and art.&nbsp; To this revival the present
writer, in the introduction to an imaginative work dealing with
this movement, has already, for convenience&rsquo; sake, and in
default of a better one, given the name of the Renascence of
Wonder.&nbsp; As was said on that occasion, &lsquo;The phrase,
the Renascence of Wonder, merely indicates that there are two
great impulses governing man, and probably not man only, but the
entire world of conscious life: the impulse of
acceptance&mdash;the impulse to take unchallenged and for granted
all the phenomena of the outer world as they are&mdash;and the
impulse to confront these phenomena with eyes of inquiry and
wonder.&rsquo;&nbsp; It would seem that something works as
inevitably and as logically as a physical law in the yearning
which societies in a certain stage of development show to get
away, as far away as possible, from the condition of the natural
man; to get away from that despised condition not only in
material affairs, such as dress, domestic arrangements and
economies, but also in the fine arts and in intellectual methods,
till, having passed that inevitable stage, each society is liable
to suffer (even if it does not in some cases actually suffer) a
reaction, <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>when nature and art are likely again to take the place
of convention and artifice.&nbsp; Anthropologists have often
asked, what was that lever-power lying enfolded in the dark womb
of some remote semi-human brain, which, by first stirring,
lifting, and vitalizing other potential and latent faculties,
gave birth to man?&nbsp; Would it be rash to assume that this
lever-power was a vigorous movement of the faculty of
wonder?&nbsp; But certainly it is not rash, as regards the races
of man, to affirm that the more intelligent the race the less it
is governed by the instinct of acceptance, and the more it is
governed by the instinct of wonder, that instinct which leads to
the movement of challenge.&nbsp; The alternate action of the two
great warring instincts is specially seen just now in the
Japanese.&nbsp; Here the instinct of challenge which results in
progress became active up to a certain point, and then suddenly
became arrested, leaving the instinct of acceptance to have full
play, and then everything became crystallized.&nbsp; Ages upon
ages of an immense activity of the instinct of challenge were
required before the Mongolian savage was developed into the
Japanese of the period before the nature-worship of
&lsquo;Shinto&rsquo; had been assaulted by dogmatic
Buddhism.&nbsp; But by that time the instinct of challenge had
resulted in such a high state of civilization that acceptance set
in and there was an end, for the time being, of progress.&nbsp;
There is no room here to say even a few words upon other great
revivals in past times, such, for instance, as the Jewish-Arabian
renascence of the ninth and tenth centuries, when the interest in
philosophical speculation, which had previously been arrested,
was revived; when the old sciences were revived; and when some
modern sciences were born.&nbsp; There are, of course, different
kinds of wonder.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>This
passage has a peculiar interest for me, because I instinctively
compare it with the author&rsquo;s speech delivered at the St.
Ives old Union Book Club dinner when he was a boy.&nbsp; It shows
the same wide vision, the same sweep, and the same rush of
eloquence.&nbsp; It is in view of this great generalization that
I have determined to quote that speech later.</p>
<p>The essay then goes on in a swift way to point out the
different kinds of wonder:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Primitive poetry is full of
wonder&mdash;the na&iuml;ve and eager wonder of the healthy
child.&nbsp; It is this kind of wonder which makes the
&lsquo;Iliad&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Odyssey&rsquo; so
delightful.&nbsp; The wonder of primitive poetry passes as the
primitive conditions of civilization pass; and then for the most
part it can only be succeeded by a very different kind of
wonder&mdash;the wonder aroused by a recognition of the mystery
of man&rsquo;s life and the mystery of nature&rsquo;s theatre on
which the human drama is played&mdash;the wonder, in short, of
&AElig;schylus and Sophocles.&nbsp; And among the Romans, Virgil,
though living under the same kind of Augustan acceptance in which
Horace, the typical poet of acceptance, lived, is full of this
latter kind of wonder.&nbsp; Among the English poets who preceded
the great Elizabethan epoch there is no room, and indeed there is
no need, to allude to any poet besides Chaucer; and even he can
only be slightly touched upon.&nbsp; He stands at the head of
those who are organized to see more clearly than we can ourselves
see the wonder of the &lsquo;world at hand.&rsquo;&nbsp; Of the
poets whose wonder is of the simply terrene kind, those whose
eyes are occupied by the beauty of the earth and the romance of
human life, he is the English king.&nbsp; But it is not the
wonder of Chaucer that is to be specially discussed in the
following sentences.&nbsp; It is the spiritual <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>wonder which
in our literature came afterwards.&nbsp; It is that kind of
wonder which filled the souls of Spenser, of Marlowe, of
Shakespeare, of Webster, of Ford, of Cyril Tourneur, and of the
old ballads: it is that poetical attitude which the human mind
assumes when confronting those unseen powers of the universe who,
if they did not weave the web in which man finds himself
entangled, dominate it.&nbsp; That this high temper should have
passed and given place to a temper of prosaic acceptance is quite
inexplicable, save by the theory of the action and reaction of
the two great warring impulses advanced in the foregoing extract
from the Introduction to &lsquo;Aylwin.&rsquo;&nbsp; Perhaps the
difference between the temper of the Elizabethan period and the
temper of the Chaucerian on the one hand, and Augustanism on the
other, will be better understood by a brief reference to the
humour of the respective periods.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then come luminous remarks upon his theory of absolute and
relative humour, which I shall deal with in relation to that type
of absolute humour, his own Mrs. Gudgeon in
&lsquo;Aylwin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I will now quote a passage from an article in the
&lsquo;Quarterly Review&rsquo; on William Morris by one of
Morris&rsquo;s intimate friends:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The decorative renascence in England is but
an expression of the spirit of the pre-Raphaelite
movement&mdash;a movement which has been defined by the most
eminent of living critics as the renascence of the &lsquo;spirit
of wonder&rsquo; in poetry and art.&nbsp; So defined, it falls
into proper relationship with the continuous development of
English literature, and of the romantic movement, during the last
century and a half, and is no longer to be <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>considered an
isolated phenomenon called into being by an erratic genius.&nbsp;
The English Romantic school, from its first inception with
Chatterton, Macpherson, and the publication of the Percy ballads,
does not, as Mr. Watts-Dunton has finely pointed out, aim merely
at the revival of natural language; it seeks rather to reach
through art and the forgotten world of old romance, that world of
wonder and mystery and spiritual beauty of which poets gain
glimpses through</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;magic
casements, opening on the foam<br />
Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In an essay on Rossetti, Mr. Watts-Dunton says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It was by inevitable instinct that Rossetti
turned to that mysterious side of nature and man&rsquo;s life
which to other painters of his time had been a mere fancy-land,
to be visited, if at all, on the wings of sport.&nbsp; It is not
only in such masterpieces of his maturity as Dante&rsquo;s Dream,
La Pia, etc., but in such early designs as How they Met
Themselves, La Belle Dame sans Merci, Cassandra, etc., that
Rossetti shows how important a figure he is in the history of
modern art, if modern art claims to be anything more than a
mechanical imitation of the facts of nature.</p>
<p>For if there is any permanent vitality in the Renascence of
Wonder in modern Europe, if it is not a mere passing mood, if it
is really the inevitable expression of the soul of man in a
certain stage of civilization (when the sanctions which have made
and moulded society are found to be not absolute and eternal, but
relative, mundane, ephemeral, and subject to the higher sanctions
of unseen powers that work behind &lsquo;the shows of <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>things&rsquo;), then perhaps one of the first questions
to ask in regard to any imaginative painter of the nineteenth
century is, In what relation does he stand to the newly-awakened
spirit of romance?&nbsp; Had he a genuine and independent
sympathy with that temper of wonder and mystery which all over
Europe had preceded and now followed the temper of imitation,
prosaic acceptance, pseudo-classicism, and domestic
materialism?&nbsp; Or was his apparent sympathy with the temper
of wonder, reverence and awe the result of artistic environment
dictated to him by other and more powerful and original souls
around him?&nbsp; I do not say that the mere fact of a
painter&rsquo;s or poet&rsquo;s showing but an imperfect sympathy
with the Renascence of Wonder is sufficient to place him below a
poet in whom that sympathy is more nearly complete, because we
should then be driven to place some of the disciples of Rossetti
above our great realistic painters, and we should be driven to
place a poet like the author of &lsquo;The Excursion&rsquo; and
&lsquo;The Prelude&rsquo; beneath a poet like the author of
&lsquo;The Queen&rsquo;s Wake&rsquo;; but we do say that, other
things being equal or anything like equal, a painter or poet of
our time is to be judged very much by his sympathy with that
great movement which we call the Renascence of Wonder&mdash;call
it so because the word romanticism never did express it even
before it had been vulgarized by French poets, dramatists,
doctrinaires, and literary harlequins.</p>
<p>To struggle against the prim traditions of the eighteenth
century, the unities of Aristotle, the delineation of types
instead of character, as Chateaubriand, Madame de Sta&euml;l,
Balzac, and Hugo struggled, was well.&nbsp; But in studying
Rossetti&rsquo;s works we reach the very key of those &lsquo;high
palaces of romance&rsquo; which the English mind had never, even
in the eighteenth century, wholly forgotten, <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>but whose
mystic gates no Frenchman ever yet unlocked.&nbsp; Not all the
romantic feeling to be found in all the French romanticists (with
their theory that not earnestness but the grotesque is the
life-blood of romance) could equal the romantic spirit expressed
in a single picture or drawing of Rossetti&rsquo;s, such, for
instance, as Beata Beatrix or Pandora.</p>
<p>For while the French romanticists&mdash;inspired by the
theories (drawn from English exemplars) of Novalis, Tieck, and
Herder&mdash;cleverly simulated the old romantic feeling, the
&lsquo;beautifully devotional feeling&rsquo; which Holman Hunt
speaks of, Rossetti was steeped in it: he was so full of the old
frank childlike wonder and awe which preceded the great
renascence of materialism that he might have lived and worked
amidst the old masters.&nbsp; Hence, in point of design, so
original is he that to match such ideas as are expressed in
Lilith, Hesterna Rosa, Michael Scott&rsquo;s Wooing, the Sea
Spell, etc., we have to turn to the sister art of poetry, where
only we can find an equally powerful artistic representation of
the idea at the core of the old romanticism&mdash;the idea of the
evil forces of nature assailing man through his sense of
beauty.&nbsp; We must turn, we say, not to art&mdash;not even to
the old masters themselves&mdash;but to the most perfect
efflorescence of the poetry of wonder and mystery&mdash;to such
ballads as &lsquo;The Demon Lover,&rsquo; to Coleridge&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Christabel&rsquo; and &lsquo;Kubla Khan,&rsquo; to
Keats&rsquo;s &lsquo;La Belle Dame sans Merci,&rsquo; for
parallels to Rossetti&rsquo;s most characteristic
designs.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These words about Coleridge recall to the students of Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s work a splendid illustration of the true
wonder of the great poetic temper which he gives in the
before-mentioned essay on The Renascence of <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>Wonder in
Chambers&rsquo;s &lsquo;Cyclop&aelig;dia of English
Literature&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Coleridge&rsquo;s &lsquo;Christabel,&rsquo;
&lsquo;The Ancient Mariner,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Kubla Khan&rsquo;
are, as regards the romantic spirit, above&mdash;and far
above&mdash;any work of any other English poet.&nbsp; Instances
innumerable might be adduced showing how his very nature was
steeped in the fountain from which the old balladists themselves
drew, but in this brief and rapid survey there is room to give
only one.&nbsp; In the &lsquo;Conclusion&rsquo; of the first part
of &lsquo;Christabel&rsquo; he recapitulates and summarizes, in
lines that are at once matchless as poetry and matchless in
succinctness of statement, the entire story of the bewitched
maiden and her terrible foe which had gone before:&mdash;</p>
<p>A star hath set, a star hath risen,<br />
O Geraldine! since arms of thine<br />
Have been the lovely lady&rsquo;s prison.<br />
O Geraldine! one hour was thine&mdash;<br />
Thou&rsquo;st had thy will!&nbsp; By tairn and rill,<br />
The night-birds all that hour were still.<br />
But now they are jubilant anew,<br />
From cliff and tower, tu-whoo! tu-whoo!<br />
Tu-whoo! tu-whoo! from wood and fell!</p>
<p>Here we get that feeling of the inextricable web in which the
human drama and external nature are woven which is the very soul
of poetic wonder.&nbsp; So great is the maleficent power of the
beautiful witch that a spell is thrown over all Nature.&nbsp; For
an hour the very woods and fells remain in a shuddering state of
sympathetic consciousness of her&mdash;</p>
<p>The night-birds all that hour were still.</p>
<p>When the spell is passed Nature awakes as from a hideous
nightmare, and &lsquo;the night-birds&rsquo; are jubilant
anew.&nbsp; <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>This is the very highest reach of poetic
wonder&mdash;finer, if that be possible, than the night-storm
during the murder of Duncan.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And now let us turn again to the essay upon Rossetti from
which I have already quoted:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Although the idea at the heart of the
highest romantic poetry (allied perhaps to that apprehension of
the warring of man&rsquo;s soul with the appetites of the flesh
which is the basis of the Christian idea), may not belong
exclusively to what we call the romantic temper (the Greeks, and
also most Asiatic peoples, were more or less familiar with it, as
we see in the &lsquo;Sal&aacute;m&aacute;n&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Abs&aacute;l&rsquo; of J&aacute;m&iacute;), yet it became
a peculiarly romantic note, as is seen from the fact that in the
old masters it resulted in that asceticism which is its logical
expression and which was once an inseparable incident of all
romantic art.&nbsp; But, in order to express this stupendous idea
as fully as the poets have expressed it, how is it possible to
adopt the asceticism of the old masters?&nbsp; This is the
question that Rossetti asked himself, and answered by his own
progress in art.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the same article, Mr. Watts-Dunton discusses the crowning
specimen of Rossetti&rsquo;s romanticism before it had, as it
were, gone to seed and passed into pure mysticism, the grand
design, &lsquo;Pandora,&rsquo; of which he possesses by far the
noblest version:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In it is seen at its highest
Rossetti&rsquo;s unique faculty of treating classical legend in
the true romantic spirit.&nbsp; The grand and sombre beauty of
Pandora&rsquo;s face, the mysterious haunting sadness in her deep
blue-grey eyes <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>as she tries in vain to re-close the fatal box from
which are still escaping the smoke and flames that shape
themselves as they curl over her head into shadowy spirit faces,
grey with agony, between tortured wings of sullen fire, are in
the highest romantic mood.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is my privilege to be allowed to give here a reproduction
of this masterpiece, for which I and my publishers cannot be too
grateful.&nbsp; The influence of Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s
teachings is seen in the fact that the idea of the Renascence of
Wonder has become expanded by theological writers and divines in
order to include within its scope subjects connected with
religion.&nbsp; Among others Dr. Robertson Nicoll has widened its
ambit in a remarkable way in an essay upon Dr. Alexander
White&rsquo;s &lsquo;Appreciation&rsquo; of Bishop Butler.&nbsp;
He quotes one of the Logia discovered by the explorers of the
Egypt Fund:&mdash;&lsquo;Let not him that seeketh cease from his
search until he find, and when he finds he shall wonder:
wondering he shall reach the kingdom, and when he reaches the
kingdom he shall have rest.&rsquo;&nbsp; He then points out that
Bishop Butler was &lsquo;one of the first to share in the
Renascence of Wonder, which was the Renascence of
religion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And now I must quote a passage alluding to the generalization
upon absolute and relative humour which I shall give later when
discussing the humour of Mrs. Gudgeon.&nbsp; I shall not be able
in these remarks to dwell upon Mr. Watts-Dunton as a humourist,
but the extracts will speak for themselves.&nbsp; Writing of the
great social Pyramid of the Augustan age, Mr. Watts-Dunton
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>&ldquo;This Augustan pyramid of ours had all the
symmetry which Blackstone so much admired in the English
constitution and its laws; and when, afterwards, the American
colonies came to revolt and set up a pyramid of their own, it was
on the Blackstonian model.&nbsp; At the base&mdash;patient as the
tortoise beneath the elephant in the Indian cosmogony&mdash;was
the people, born to be the base and born for nothing else.&nbsp;
Resting on this foundation were the middle classes in their
various strata, each stratum sharply marked off from the
others.&nbsp; Then above these was the strictly genteel class,
the patriciate, picturesque and elegant in dress if in nothing
else, whose privileges were theirs as a matter of right.&nbsp;
Above the patriciate was the earthly source of gentility, the
monarch, who would, no doubt, have been the very apex of the
sacred structure save that a little&mdash;a very
little&mdash;above him sat God, the suzerain to whom the prayers
even of the monarch himself were addressed.&nbsp; The leaders of
the Rebellion had certainly done a daring thing, and an original
thing, by striking off the apex of this pyramid, and it might
reasonably have been expected that the building itself would
collapse and crumble away.&nbsp; But it did nothing of the
kind.&nbsp; It was simply a pyramid with the apex cut off&mdash;a
structure to serve afterwards as a model of the American and
French pyramids, both of which, though aspiring to be original
structures, are really built on exactly the same scheme of
hereditary honour and dishonour as that upon which the pyramids
of Nineveh and Babylon were no doubt built.&nbsp; Then came the
Restoration: the apex was restored: the structure was again
complete; it was, indeed, more solid than ever, stronger than
ever.</p>
<p>With regard to what we have called the realistic side of the
romantic movement as distinguished from its <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>purely
poetical and supernatural side, Nature was for the Augustan
temper much too ungenteel to be described realistically.&nbsp;
Yet we must not suppose that in the eighteenth century Nature
turned out men without imaginations, without the natural gift of
emotional speech, and without the faculty of gazing honestly in
her face.&nbsp; She does not work in that way.&nbsp; In the time
of the mammoth and the cave-bear she will give birth to a great
artist whose materials may be a flint and a tusk.&nbsp; In the
period before Greece was Greece, among a handful of Achaians she
will give birth to the greatest poet, or, perhaps we should say,
the greatest group of poets, the world has ever yet seen.&nbsp;
In the time of Elizabeth she will give birth, among the
illiterate yeomen of a diminutive country town, to a dramatist
with such inconceivable insight and intellectual breadth that his
generalizations cover not only the intellectual limbs of his own
time, but the intellectual limbs of so complex an epoch as the
twentieth century.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rossetti had the theory, I believe, that important as humour
is in prose fiction and also in worldly verse, it cannot be got
into romantic poetry, as he himself understood romantic poetry;
for he did not class ballads like Kinmont Willie, where there are
such superb touches of humour, among the romantic ballads.&nbsp;
And, as Mr. Watts-Dunton has somewhere remarked, his poems, like
Morris&rsquo;s, are entirely devoid of humour, although both the
poets were humourists.&nbsp; But the readers of Rhona&rsquo;s
Letters in &lsquo;The Coming of Love&rsquo; will admit that a
delicious humour can be imported into the highest romantic
poetry.</p>
<p>With one more quotation from the essay in Chambers&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Cyclop&aelig;dia of English Literature,&rsquo; I must
conclude <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>my remarks upon the keynote of all Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s work, whether imaginative or
critical:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The period of wonder in English poetry may
perhaps be said to have ended with Milton.&nbsp; For Milton,
although born only twenty-three years before the first of the
great poets of acceptance, Dryden, belongs properly to the period
of romantic poetry.&nbsp; He has no relation whatever to the
poetry of Augustanism which followed Dryden, and which Dryden
received partly from France and partly from certain
contemporaries of the great romantic dramatists themselves,
headed by Ben Jonson.&nbsp; From the moment when Augustanism
really began&mdash;in the latter decades of the seventeenth
century&mdash;the periwig poetry of Dryden and Pope crushed out
all the natural singing of the true poets.&nbsp; All the periwig
poets became too &lsquo;polite&rsquo; to be natural.&nbsp; As
acceptance is, of course, the parent of Augustanism or gentility,
the most genteel character in the world is a Chinese mandarin, to
whom everything is vulgar that contradicts the symmetry of the
pyramid of Cathay.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the things I purpose to show in this book is that the
most powerful expression of the Renascence of Wonder is not in
Rossetti&rsquo;s poems, nor yet in his pictures, nor is it in
&lsquo;Aylwin,&rsquo; but in &lsquo;The Coming of
Love.&rsquo;&nbsp; But in order fully to understand Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s work it is necessary to know something of
his life-history, and thanks to the aid I have received from
certain of his friends, and also to a little topographical work,
the &lsquo;History of St. Ives,&rsquo; by Mr. Herbert E. Norris,
F.E.S., I shall be able to give glimpses of his early life long
before he was known in London.</p>
<h2><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>Chapter II<br />
COWSLIP COUNTRY</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> time ago I was dipping into
the &lsquo;official pictorial guides&rsquo; of those three great
trunk railways, the Midland, the Great Northern, and the Great
Eastern, being curious to see what they had to say about St.
Ives&mdash;not the famous town in Cornwall, but the little town
in Huntingdonshire where, according to Carlyle, Oliver Cromwell
spent those five years of meditation upon which his after life
was nourished.&nbsp; In the Great Northern Guide I stumbled upon
these words: &lsquo;At Slepe Hall dwelt the future Lord
Protector, Oliver Cromwell, but by many this little
Huntingdonshire town will be even better known as the birthplace
of Mr. Theodore Watts-Dunton, whose exquisite examples of the
English sonnet and judicious criticisms in the kindred realms of
poetry and art are familiar to lovers of our national
literature.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; I thought, when I
found similar remarks in the other two guides, &lsquo;here at
least is one case in which a prophet has honour in his own
country.&rsquo;&nbsp; This set me musing over a subject which had
often tantalized me during my early Irish days, the whimsical
workings of the Spirit of Place.&nbsp; To a poet, what are the
advantages and what are the disadvantages of being born in a
microcosm like St. Ives?&nbsp; If the fame of Mr. Watts-Dunton as
a poet were as great as that of his living friend, Mr. Swinburne,
or as that of his dead friend, Rossetti, I should not have been
surprised to find the place of his birth thus <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>associated
with his name.&nbsp; But whether or not Rossetti was right in
saying that Mr. Watts-Dunton &lsquo;had sought obscurity as other
poets seek fame,&rsquo; it is certain that until quite lately he
neglected to claim his proper place among his peers.&nbsp;
Doubtless, as the &lsquo;Journal des D&eacute;bats&rsquo; has
pointed out, the very originality of his work, both in subject
and in style, has retarded the popular recognition of its unique
quality; but although the names of Rossetti and Swinburne echo
through the world, there is one respect in which they were less
lucky than their friend.&nbsp; They were born in the macrocosm of
London, where the Spirit of Place has so much to attend to that
his memory can find but a small corner even for the author of
&lsquo;The Blessed Damozel,&rsquo; or for the author of
&lsquo;Atalanta in Calydon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Watts-Dunton was born in the microcosm which was in those
corn law repeal days a little metropolis in Cowslip
Country&mdash;Buttercup Land, as the Ouse lanes are sometimes
called, and therefore he was born to good luck.&nbsp; Cowslip
Country will be as closely associated with him and with Rhona
Boswell as Wessex is associated with Thomas Hardy and with Tess
of the D&rsquo;Urbervilles.&nbsp; For the poet born in a
microcosm becomes identified with it in the public eye, whereas
the poet born in a macrocosm is seldom associated with his
birthplace.</p>
<p>To the novelist, if not to the poet, there is a still greater
advantage in being born in a microcosm.&nbsp; He sees the drama
of life from a point of view entirely different from that of the
novelist born in the macrocosm.&nbsp; The human microbe, or, as
Mr. John Morley might prefer to say, the human cheese-mite in the
macrocosm sees every other microbe or every other cheese-mite on
the flat, but in the microcosm he sees every other microbe or
every other cheese-mite in the round.</p>
<p><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s work is saturated with memories of the
Ouse.&nbsp; Cowper had already described the Ouse, but it was Mr.
Watts-Dunton who first flung the rainbow of romance over the
river and over the sweet meadows of Cowslip Land, through which
it flows.&nbsp; In these lines he has described a sunset on the
Ouse:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>More mellow falls the light and still more
mellow<br />
Around the boat, as we two glide along<br />
&rsquo;Tween grassy banks she loves where, tall and strong,<br />
The buttercups stand gleaming, smiling, yellow.<br />
She knows the nightingales of &lsquo;Portobello&rsquo;;<br />
Love makes her know each bird!&nbsp; In all that throng<br />
No voice seems like another: soul is song,<br />
And never nightingale was like its fellow;<br />
For, whether born in breast of Love&rsquo;s own bird,<br />
Singing its passion in those islet bowers<br />
Whose sunset-coloured maze of leaves and flowers<br />
The rosy river&rsquo;s glowing arms engird,<br />
Or born in human souls&mdash;twin souls like ours&mdash;<br />
Song leaps from deeps unplumbed by spoken word.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Now, will it be believed that this lovely river&mdash;so
famous too among English anglers for its roach, perch, pike,
dace, chub, and gudgeon&mdash;has been libelled?&nbsp; Yes, it
has been libelled, and libelled by no less a person than Thomas
Carlyle.&nbsp; Mr. Norris, vindicating with righteous wrath the
reputation of his beloved Ouse, says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There is, as far as I know, nothing like
the Ouse elsewhere in England.&nbsp; I do not mean that our river
surpasses or even equals in picturesqueness such rivers as the
Wye, the Severn, the Thames, but that its beauty is unique.&nbsp;
There is not to be seen anywhere else so wide and stately a
stream moving so slowly and yet so clearly.&nbsp; Consequently
there is no other river which reflects with <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>such beauty
the scenery of the clouds floating overhead.&nbsp; This, I think,
is owing to the stream moving over a bottom which is both flat
and gravelly.&nbsp; When Carlyle spoke of the Ouse dragging in a
half-stagnant way under a coating of floating oils, he showed
&lsquo;how vivid were his perceptive faculties and also how
untrustworthy.&rsquo;&nbsp; I have made a good deal of enquiry
into the matter of Carlyle&rsquo;s visit to St. Ives, and have
learnt that, having spent some time exploring Ely Cathedral in
search of mementoes of Cromwell, he rode on to St. Ives, and
spent about an hour there before proceeding on his journey.&nbsp;
Among the objects at which he gave a hasty glance was the river,
covered from the bridge to the Holmes by one of those enormous
fleets of barges which were frequently to be seen at that time,
and it was from the newly tarred keels of this fleet of barges
that came the oily exudation which Carlyle, in his ignorance of
the physical sciences and his contempt for them, believed to
arise from a greasy river-bottom.&nbsp; And to this mistake the
world is indebted for this description of the Ouse, which has
been slavishly followed by all subsequent writers on
Cromwell.&nbsp; This is what makes strangers, walking along the
tow-path of Hemingford meadow, express so much surprise when,
instead of seeing the oily scum they expected, they see a broad
mirror as clear as glass, whose iridescence is caused by the
reflection of the clouds overhead and by the gold and white water
lilies on the surface of the stream.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the beauty of the Ouse inspired Mr. Norris to praise it so
eloquently in prose, we need not wonder at the pictorial
fascination of what Rossetti styled in a letter to a friend
&lsquo;Watts&rsquo;s magnificent star sonnet&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>The mirrored stars lit all the bulrush spears,<br
/>
And all the flags and broad-leaved lily-isles;<br />
<a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>The
ripples shook the stars to golden smiles,<br />
Then smoothed them back to happy golden spheres.<br />
We rowed&mdash;we sang; her voice seemed in mine ears<br />
An angel&rsquo;s, yet with woman&rsquo;s dearer wiles;<br />
But shadows fell from gathering cloudy piles<br />
And ripples shook the stars to fiery tears.</p>
<p>What shaped those shadows like another boat<br />
Where Rhona sat and he Love made a liar?<br />
There, where the Scollard sank, I saw it float,<br />
While ripples shook the stars to symbols dire;<br />
We wept&mdash;we kissed&mdash;while starry fingers wrote,<br />
And ripples shook the stars to a snake of fire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Mr. Sharp, Rossetti pronounced this sonnet to be
the finest of all the versions of the Doppelganger idea, and for
many years he seriously purposed to render it in art.&nbsp; It is
easy to understand why Rossetti never carried out his intention,
for the pictorial magic of the sonnet is so powerful that even
the greatest of all romantic painters could hardly have rendered
it on canvas.&nbsp; Poetry can suggest to the imagination deeper
mysteries than the subtlest romantic painting.</p>
<p>No sonnet has been more frequently localized&mdash;erroneously
localized than this.&nbsp; It is often supposed to depict the
Thames above Kew, but Mr. Norris says that &lsquo;every one
familiar with Hemingford Meadow will see that it describes the
Ouse backwater near Porto Bello, where the author as a young man
was constantly seen on summer evenings listening from a canoe to
the blackcaps and nightingales of the Thicket.&rsquo;</p>
<p>That excellent critic, Mr. Earl Hodgson, the editor of Dr.
Gordon Hake&rsquo;s &lsquo;New Day,&rsquo; seems to think that
the &lsquo;lily-isles&rsquo; are on the Thames at Kelmscott,
while other writers have frequently localized these
&lsquo;lily-isles&rsquo; <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>on the Avon at Stratford.&nbsp; But,
no doubt, Mr. Norris is right in placing them on the Ouse.</p>
<p>This, however, gives me a good opportunity of saying a few
words about Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s love of the Avon.&nbsp; The
sacred old town of Stratford-on-Avon has always been a favourite
haunt of Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s.&nbsp; No poet of our time has
shown a greater love of our English rivers, but he seems to love
the Avon even more passionately than the Ouse.&nbsp; He cannot
describe the soft sands of Petit Bot Bay in Guernsey without
bringing in an allusion to &lsquo;Avon&rsquo;s sacred
silt.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was at Stratford-on-Avon that he wrote
several of his poems, notably the two sonnets which appeared
first in the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um,&rsquo; and afterwards in the
little volume, &lsquo;Jubilee Greetings at Spithead to the Men of
Greater Britain.&rsquo;&nbsp; They are entitled &lsquo;The Breath
of Avon: To English-speaking Pilgrims on Shakspeare&rsquo;s
Birthday&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Whate&rsquo;er of woe the Dark may hide in womb<br
/>
For England, mother of kings of battle and song&mdash;<br />
Rapine, or racial hate&rsquo;s mysterious wrong,<br />
Blizzard of Chance, or fiery dart of Doom&mdash;<br />
Let breath of Avon, rich of meadow-bloom,<br />
Bind her to that great daughter sever&rsquo;d long&mdash;<br />
To near and far-off children young and strong&mdash;<br />
With fetters woven of Avon&rsquo;s flower perfume.<br />
Welcome, ye English-speaking pilgrims, ye<br />
Whose hands around the world are join&rsquo;d by him,<br />
Who make his speech the language of the sea,<br />
Till winds of Ocean waft from rim to rim<br />
The Breath of Avon: let this great day be<br />
A Feast of Race no power shall ever dim.</p>
<p>From where the steeds of Earth&rsquo;s twin oceans toss<br />
Their manes along Columbia&rsquo;s chariot-way;<br />
From where Australia&rsquo;s long blue billows play;<br />
<a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>From where
the morn, quenching the Southern Cross,<br />
Startling the frigate-bird and albatross<br />
Asleep in air, breaks over Table Bay&mdash;<br />
Come hither, pilgrims, where these rushes sway<br />
&rsquo;Tween grassy banks of Avon soft as moss!<br />
For, if ye found the breath of Ocean sweet,<br />
Sweeter is Avon&rsquo;s earthy, flowery smell,<br />
Distill&rsquo;d from roots that feel the coming spell<br />
Of May, who bids all flowers that lov&rsquo;d him meet<br />
In meadows that, remembering Shakspeare&rsquo;s feet,<br />
Hold still a dream of music where they fell.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was during a visit to Stratford-on-Avon in 1880 that Mr.
Watts-Dunton wrote the cantata, &lsquo;Christmas at the
Mermaid,&rsquo; a poem in which breathes the very atmosphere of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s town.&nbsp; There are no poetical
descriptions of the Avon that can stand for a moment beside the
descriptions in this poem, which I shall discuss later.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>A typical meadow of Cowslip Country, or, as it is sometimes
called, &lsquo;The Green Country,&rsquo; is Hemingford Meadow,
adjoining St. Ives.&nbsp; It is a level tract of land on the
banks of the Ouse, consisting of deposits of alluvium from the
overflowings of the river.&nbsp; In summer it is clothed with gay
flowers, and in winter, during floods and frosts, it is used as a
skating-ground, for St. Ives, being on the border of the Fens, is
a famous skating centre.&nbsp; On the opposite side of the meadow
is The Thicket, of which I am able to give a lovely
picture.&nbsp; This, no doubt, is the scene described in one of
Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s birthday addresses to
Tennyson:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Another birthday breaks: he is with us still.<br
/>
There through the branches of the glittering trees<br />
The birthday sun gilds grass and flower: the breeze<br />
Sends forth methinks a thrill&mdash;a conscious thrill<br />
<a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>That tells
yon meadows by the steaming rill&mdash;<br />
Where, o&rsquo;er the clover waiting for the bees,<br />
The mist shines round the cattle to their knees&mdash;<br />
&lsquo;Another birthday breaks: he is with us still!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The meadow leads to what the &lsquo;oldest rustic
inhabitant&rsquo; calls the &lsquo;First Hemingford,&rsquo; or
&lsquo;Hemingford Grey.&rsquo;&nbsp; The imagination of this same
&lsquo;oldest inhabitant&rsquo; used to go even beyond the First
Hemingford to the Second Hemingford, and then of course came
Ultima Thule!&nbsp; The meadow has quite a wide fame among those
students of nature who love English grasses in their endless
varieties.&nbsp; Owing to the richness of the soil, the luxuriant
growth of these beautiful grasses is said to be unparalleled in
England.&nbsp; For years the two Hemingfords have been the
favourite haunt of a group of landscape painters the chief of
whom are the brothers Fraser, two of whose water-colours are
reproduced in this book.</p>

<p>Nowhere can the bustling activity of haymaking be seen to more
advantage than in Cowslip Country, which extends right through
Huntingdonshire into East Anglia.&nbsp; It was not, however, near
St. Ives, but in another somewhat distant part of Cowslip Country
that the gypsies depicted in &lsquo;The Coming of Love&rsquo;
took an active part in haymaking.&nbsp; But alas! in these times
of mechanical haymaking the lover of local customs can no longer
hope to see such a picture as that painted in the now famous
gypsy haymaking song which Mr. Watts-Dunton puts into the mouth
of Rhona Boswell.&nbsp; Moreover, the prosperous gryengroes
depicted by Borrow and by the author of &lsquo;The Coming of
Love&rsquo; have now entirely vanished from the scene.&nbsp; The
present generation knows them not.&nbsp; But it is impossible for
the student of Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s poetry to ramble along
any part <a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>of Cowslip Country, with the fragrance of newly-made hay
in his nostrils, without recalling this chant, which I have the
kind permission of the editor of the &lsquo;Saturday
Review&rsquo; (April 19, 1902) to quote:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. Norris tells us that the old Saxon name of St. Ives was
Slepe, and that Oliver Cromwell is said to have resided as a
farmer for five years in Slepe Hall, which was pulled down in the
late forties.&nbsp; When Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s friend, Madox
Brown, went down to St. Ives to paint the scenery for his famous
picture, &lsquo;Oliver Cromwell at St. Ives,&rsquo; he could
present only an imaginary farm.</p>
<p>Perhaps my theory about the advantage of a story-teller being
born in a microcosm accounts for that faculty of improvizing
stories full of local colour and character which, according to
friends of D. G. Rossetti, would keep the poet-painter up half
the night, and which was dwelt upon by Mr. Hake in his account of
the origin of &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; which I have already
given.&nbsp; I may give here an anecdote connected with Slepe
Hall which I have heard Mr. Watts-Dunton tell, and which would
certainly make a good nucleus for a short story.&nbsp; It is
connected with Slepe Hall, of which Mr. Clement Shorter, in some
reminiscences of his published some time ago, writes: &ldquo;My
mother was born at St. Ives, in Huntingdonshire, and still owns
by inheritance some <a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>freehold cottages built on land once occupied by Slepe
Hall, where Oliver Cromwell is supposed to have farmed.&nbsp; At
Slepe Hall, a picturesque building, she went to school in
girlhood.&nbsp; She remembers Mr. Watts-Dunton, the author of
&lsquo;Aylwin,&rsquo; who was also born at St. Ives, as a pretty
little boy then unknown to fame.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>When the owners of Slepe Hall, the White family, pulled it
down, they sold the materials of the building and also the site
and grounds in building lots.&nbsp; It was then discovered that
the house in which Cromwell was said to have lived was built upon
the foundations of a much older house whose cellars remained
intact.&nbsp; This was, of course, a tremendous event in the
microcosm, and the place became a rendezvous of the schoolboys of
the neighbourhood, whose delight from morning to eve was to watch
the workmen in their task of demolition.&nbsp; In the early
stages of this work, when the upper stories were being
demolished, curiosity was centred on the great question as to
what secret chamber would be found, whence Oliver
Cromwell&rsquo;s ghost, before he was driven into hiding by his
terror of the school girls, used to issue, to take his moonlit
walks about the grounds, and fish for roach in the old fish
ponds.&nbsp; But no such secret chamber could be found.&nbsp;
When at length the work had proceeded so far as the foundations,
the centre of curiosity was shifted: a treasure was supposed to
be hidden there; for, although, as a matter of fact, Cromwell was
born at Huntingdon and lived at St. Ives only five years, it was
not at Huntingdon, but at the little Nonconformist town of St.
Ives, that he was the idol: it was indeed the old story of every
hero of the world&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Imposteur &agrave; la Mecque et proph&egrave;te
&agrave; M&egrave;dine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although in all probability Cromwell never lived <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>at Slepe
Hall, but at the Green End Farm at the other end of the town,
there was a legend that, before the Ironsides started on a famous
expedition, Noll went back to St. Ives and concealed his own
plate, and the plate of all his rebel friends, in Slepe Hall
cellars.&nbsp; No treasure turned up, but what was found was a
collection of old bottles of wine which was at once christened
&lsquo;Cromwell&rsquo;s wine&rsquo; by the local humourist of the
town, who was also one of its most prosperous inhabitants, and
who felt as much interest as the boys in the exploration.&nbsp;
The workmen, of course, at once began knocking off the
bottles&rsquo; necks and drinking the wine, and were soon in what
may be called a mellow condition; the humourist, being a
teetotaler, would not drink, but he insisted on the boys being
allowed to take away their share of it in order that they might
say in after days that they had drunk Oliver Cromwell&rsquo;s
wine and perhaps imbibed some of the Cromwellian spirit and
pluck.&nbsp; Consequently the young urchins carried off a few
bottles and sat down in a ring under a tree called
&lsquo;Oliver&rsquo;s Tree,&rsquo; and knocked off the tops of
the bottles and began to drink.&nbsp; The wine turned out to be
extremely sweet, thick and sticky, and appears to have been a
wine for which Cowslip Land has always been famous&mdash;elder
wine.&nbsp; Abstemious by temperament and by rearing as Mr.
Watts-Dunton was, he could not resist the temptation to drink
freely of Cromwell&rsquo;s elder-wine; so freely, in fact, that
he has said, &lsquo;I was never even excited by drink except
once, and that was when I came near to being drunk on Oliver
Cromwell&rsquo;s elder-wine.&rsquo;&nbsp; The wine was probably
about a century old.</p>
<p>I should have stated that Mr. Watts-Dunton at the age of
eleven or twelve was sent to a school at Cambridge, <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>where he
remained for a longer time than is usual.&nbsp; He received there
and afterwards at home a somewhat elaborate education, comprising
the physical sciences, particularly biology, and also art and
music.&nbsp; As has been said in the notice of him in
&lsquo;Poets and Poetry of the Century,&rsquo; he is one of the
few contemporary poets with a scientific knowledge of
music.&nbsp; Owing to his father&rsquo;s passion for science, he
was specially educated as a naturalist, and this accounts for the
innumerable allusions to natural science in his writings, and for
his many expressions of a passionate interest in the lower
animals.</p>
<p>Upon the subject of &ldquo;the great human fallacy expressed
in the phrase, &lsquo;the dumb animals,&rsquo;&rdquo; Mr.
Watts-Dunton has written much, and he has often been eloquent
about &lsquo;those who have seen through the fallacy, such as St.
Francis of Assisi, Cowper, Burns, Coleridge, and Bisset, the
wonderful animal-trainer of Perth of the last century, who, if we
are to believe the accounts of him, taught a turtle in six months
to fetch and carry like a dog; and having chalked the floor and
blackened its claws, could direct it to trace out any given name
in the company.&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;the
&lsquo;lower animals&rsquo; are no more dumb than we are.&nbsp;
With them, as with us, there is the same yearning to escape from
isolation&mdash;to get as close as may be to some other conscious
thing&mdash;which is a great factor of progress.&nbsp; With them,
as with us, each individual tries to warm itself by communication
with the others around it by arbitrary signs; with them, as with
us, countless accidents through countless years have contributed
to determine what these signs and sounds shall be.&nbsp; Those
among us who have gone at all underneath conventional <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>thought and
conventional expression&mdash;those who have penetrated
underneath conventional feeling&mdash;know that neither thought
nor emotion can really be expressed at all.&nbsp; The voice
cannot do it, as we see by comparing one language with
another.&nbsp; Wordsworth calls language the incarnation of
thought.&nbsp; But the mere fact of there being such a Babel of
different tongues disproves this.&nbsp; If there were but one
universal language, such as speculators dream of, the idea might,
at least, be not superficially absurd.&nbsp; Soul cannot
communicate with soul save by signs made by the body; and when
you can once establish a Lingua Franca between yourself and a
&lsquo;lower animal,&rsquo; interchange of feeling and even of
thought is as easy with them as it is with men.&nbsp; Nay, with
some temperaments and in some moods, the communication is far,
far closer.&nbsp; &lsquo;When I am assailed with heavy
tribulation,&rsquo; said Luther, &lsquo;I rush out among my pigs
rather than remain alone by myself.&rsquo;&nbsp; And there is no
creature that does not at some points sympathize with man.&nbsp;
People have laughed at Erskine because every evening after dinner
he used to have placed upon the table a vessel full of his pet
leeches, upon which he used to lavish his endearments.&nbsp;
Neither I nor my companion had a pet passion for leeches.&nbsp;
Erskine probably knew leeches better than we, for, as the Arabian
proverb says, mankind hate only the thing of which they know
nothing.&nbsp; Like most dog lovers, we had no special love for
cats, but that was clearly from lack of knowledge.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
wish women would purr when they are pleased,&rsquo; said Horne
Tooke to Rogers once.&rdquo;</p>

THE CRITIC IN THE BUD</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of my special weaknesses is my
delight in forgotten records of the nooks of old England and
&lsquo;ould Ireland&rsquo;; I have a propensity for
&lsquo;dawdling and dandering&rsquo; among them whenever the
occasion arises, and I am yielding to it here.</p>
<p>Besides the interesting history of St. Ives from which I have
been compelled to quote so liberally, Mr. Norris has written a
series of brochures upon the surrounding villages.&nbsp; One of
these, called &lsquo;St. Ives and the Printing Press,&rsquo; has
greatly interested me, for it reveals the wealth of the material
for topographical literature which in the rural districts lies
ready for the picking up.&nbsp; I am tempted to quote from this,
for it shows how strong since Cromwell&rsquo;s time the temper
which produced Cromwell has remained.&nbsp; During the time when
at Cambridge George Dyer and his associates, William Frend,
Fellow of Jesus, and John Hammond of Fenstanton, Fellow of
Queen&rsquo;s, revolted against the discipline and the doctrine
of the Church of England, St. Ives was the very place where the
Cambridge revolutionists had their books printed.&nbsp; The house
whence issued these fulminations was the &lsquo;Old House&rsquo;
in Crown Street, now pulled down, which for a time belonged to
Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s father, having remained during all this
time a printing office.&nbsp; Mr. <a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>Norris gives a very picturesque
description of this old printing office at the top of the house,
with its pointed roof, &lsquo;king posts&rsquo; and panelling,
reminding one of the pictures of the ancient German printing
offices.&nbsp; Mr. Norris also tells us that it was at the house
adjoining this, the &lsquo;Crown Inn,&rsquo; that William Penn
died in 1718, having ridden thither from Huntingdon to hear the
lawsuit between himself and the St. Ives churchwardens.&nbsp;
According to Mr. Norris, the fountain-head of the Cambridge
revolt was the John Hammond above alluded to, who was a friend of
Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s father when the latter was quite a young
man under articles for a solicitor.&nbsp; A curious character
must have been this long-forgotten rebel, to whom Dyer addressed
an ode, with an enormous tail of learned notes showing the
eccentric pedantry which was such an infinite source of amusement
to Lamb, and inspired some of Elia&rsquo;s most delightful
touches of humour.&nbsp; This poem of Dyer&rsquo;s opens
thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Though much I love th&rsquo; &AElig;olian lyre,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose varying sounds beguil&rsquo;d my youthful
day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And still, as fancy guides, I love to stray<br />
In fabled groves, among th&rsquo; Aonian choir:<br />
Yet more on native fields, thro&rsquo; milder skies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nature&rsquo;s mysterious harmonies delight:<br />
There rests my heart; for let the sun but rise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the moon&rsquo;s pale orb that cheer&rsquo;d
the lonesome night?<br />
I cannot leave thee, classic ground,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor bid your labyrinths of song adieu;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet scenes to me more dear arise to view:<br />
And my ear drinks in notes of clearer sound.<br />
No purple Venus round my Hammond&rsquo;s bow&rsquo;r,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No blue-ey&rsquo;d graces, wanton mirth diffuse,<br
/>
The king of gods here rains no golden show&rsquo;r,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor have these lips e&rsquo;er sipt Castilian
dews.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>At the
&lsquo;Old House&rsquo; in Crown Street there used to be held in
Dyer&rsquo;s time, if not earlier, the meetings of the St. Ives
old Union Book Club, and at this very Book Club, Walter Theodore
Watts first delivered himself of his boyish ideas about science,
literature, and things in general.&nbsp; Filled with juvenile
emphasis as it is, I mean to give here nearly in full that boyish
utterance.&nbsp; It interests me much, because I seem to see in
it adumbrations of many interesting extracts from his works with
which I hope to enrich these pages.&nbsp; I cannot let slip the
opportunity of taking advantage of a lucky accident&mdash;the
accident that a member of Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s family was
able to furnish me with an old yellow-brown newspaper cutting in
which the speech is reported.&nbsp; In 1854, &lsquo;W. Theodore
Watts,&rsquo; as he is described in the cutting, although too
young to be himself a member&mdash;if he was not still at school
at Cambridge, he had just left it&mdash;on account of his
father&rsquo;s great local reputation as a man of learning, was
invited to the dinner, and called upon to respond to the toast,
&lsquo;Science.&rsquo;&nbsp; In the &lsquo;Cambridge
Chronicle&rsquo; of that date the proceedings of the dinner were
reported, and great prominence was given to the speech of the
precocious boy, a speech delivered, as is evident by the
allusions to persons present, without a single note, and largely
improvized.&nbsp; The subject which he discussed was &lsquo;The
Influence of Science upon Modern Civilization&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is one of the many beautiful remarks of
the great philosophical lawyer, Lord Bacon, that knowledge
resembles a tree, which runs straight for some time, and then
parts itself into branches.&nbsp; Now, of all the branches of the
tree of knowledge, in my opinion, the most hopeful one for
humanity is physical science&mdash;that branch <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>of the tree
which, before the time of the great lawyer, had scarcely begun to
bud, and which he, above all men, helped to bring to its present
wondrous state of development.&nbsp; I am aware that the
assertion that Lord Bacon is the Father of Physical Science will
be considered by many of you as rather heterodox, and fitting to
come from a person young and inexperienced as myself.&nbsp; It is
heterodox; it clashes, for instance, with the venerable
superstition of &lsquo;the wisdom of the ancients&rsquo;&mdash;a
superstition, by the bye, as old in our literature as my friend
Mr. Wright&rsquo;s old friend Chaucer, whom we have this moment
been talking about, and who, I remember, has this sarcastic verse
to the point:&mdash;</p>
<p>For out of the olde fieldes, as men saith,<br />
Cometh all this new corn from yeare to yeare,<br />
And out of olde bookes; in good faith,<br />
Cometh all this new science that men lere.</p>
<p>But, gentlemen, if by the wisdom of the ancients we mean their
wisdom in matters of Physical Science (as some do), I contend
that we simply abuse terms; and that the phrase, whether applied
to the ancients more properly, or to our own English ancestors,
is a fallacy.&nbsp; It is the error of applying qualities to
communities of men which belong only to individuals.&nbsp; There
can be no doubt that, of contemporary individuals, the oldest of
them has had the greatest experience, and is therefore, or ought
therefore, to be the wisest; but with generations of men, surely
the reverse of this must be the fact.&nbsp; As Sydney Smith says
in his own inimitably droll way, &lsquo;Those who came first (our
ancestors), are the young people, and have the least
experience.&nbsp; Our ancestors up to the Conquest were children
in arms&mdash;chubby boys in the time of Edward the First;
striplings under Elizabeth; <a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>men in the reign of Queen Anne; and
we only are the white-bearded, silver-headed ancients who have
treasured up, and are prepared to profit by, all the experience
which human life can supply.</p>
<p>And, gentlemen, I think the wit was right, both as regards our
own English ancestors, and the nations of antiquity.&nbsp; What,
for instance, was the much-vaunted Astronomy of the ancient
Chaldeans&mdash;what but the wildest Astrology?&nbsp; What
schoolboy has not chuckled over the ingenious old
Herodotus&rsquo;s description of the sun being blown out of the
heavens?&nbsp; Or again, at old Plutarch&rsquo;s veracious story
of the hedgehogs and the grapes?&nbsp; Nay, there are absurdities
enough in such great philosophers as Pliny, Plato, and Aristotle,
to convince us that the ancients were profoundly ignorant in most
matters appertaining to the Physical Sciences.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I would be the last one in the room to disparage
the ancients: my admiration of them amounts simply to
reverence.&nbsp; But theirs was essentially the day of poetry and
imagination; our day&mdash;though there are still poets among us,
as Alexander Smith has been proving to us lately&mdash;is, as
essentially, the day of Science.&nbsp; I might, if I had time,
dwell upon another point here&mdash;the constitution of the Greek
mind (for it is upon Greece I am now especially looking as the
soul of antiquity).&nbsp; Was that scientific?&nbsp; Surely
not.</p>
<p>The predominant intuition of the Greek mind, as you well know,
was beauty, sensuous beauty.&nbsp; This prevailing passion for
the beautiful exhibits itself in everything they did, and in
everything they said: it breathes in their poetry, in their
oratory, in their drama, in their architecture, and above all in
their marvellous sculpture.&nbsp; The productions of the Greek
intellect are pure temples <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>of the beautiful, and, as such, will
never fade and decay, for</p>
<p style="text-align: center">A thing of beauty is a joy for
ever.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I may as well confess at once that I believe
that Science could never have found a home in the Europe of
antiquity.&nbsp; Athens was too imaginative and poetical.&nbsp;
Sparta was too warlike and barbarous.&nbsp; Rome was too sensual
and gross.&nbsp; It had to wait for the steady Teutonic
mind&mdash;the plodding brains of modern England and modern
Germany.&nbsp; That Homer is the father of poetry&mdash;that
&AElig;schylus is a wonder of sublimity&mdash;that Sophocles and
Euripides are profound masters of human passion and human
pathos&mdash;that Aristophanes is an exhaustless fountain of
sparkling wit and richest humour&mdash;no one in this room, or
out of it, is more willing to admit than I am.&nbsp; But is that
to blind us to the fact, gentlemen, that Humboldt and Murchison
and Lyell are greater natural philosophers than Lucretius or
Aristotle?</p>
<p>The Athenian philosopher, Socrates, believed that he was
accompanied through life by a spiritual good genius and evil
genius.&nbsp; Every right action he did, and every right thought
that entered his mind, he attributed to the influence of his good
Genius; while every bad thought and action he attributed to his
evil Genius.&nbsp; And this was not the mere poetic figment of a
poetic brain: it was a living and breathing faith with him.&nbsp;
He believed it in his childhood, in his youth, in his manhood,
and he believed it on his death-bed, when the deadly hemlock was
winding its fold, like the fatal serpent of Laocoon, around his
giant brain.&nbsp; Well, gentlemen, don&rsquo;t let us laugh at
this idea of the grand old Athenian; for it is, after all, a
beautiful one, and typical of many great truths.&nbsp; And I have
often thought that the idea might be applied to a greater man
than Socrates.&nbsp; I <a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>mean the great
man&mdash;mankind.&nbsp; He, too, has his good genius and his
evil genius.&nbsp; The former we will designate science, the
latter we will call superstition.&nbsp; For ages upon ages,
superstition has had the sway over him&mdash;that evil genius,
who blotted out the lamp of truth that God had implanted within
his breast, and substituted all manner of blinding
errors&mdash;errors which have made him play</p>
<p>Such fantastic tricks before high heaven<br />
As make the angels weep.</p>
<p>This evil genius it was who made him look upon the fair face
of creation, not as a book in which God may be read, as St. Paul
tells us, but as a book full of frightful and horrid
mysteries.&nbsp; In a word, the great Man who ought to have been
only a little lower than the angels, has been made, by
superstition, only a little above the fiends.</p>
<p>But, at last, God has permitted man&rsquo;s long, long
experience to be followed by wisdom; and we have thrown off the
yoke of this ancient enemy, and clasped the hands of
Science&mdash;Science, that good genius who makes matter the
obedient slave of mind; who imprisons the ethereal lightning and
makes it the messenger of commerce; who reigns king of the raging
sea and winds; who compresses the life of Methusaleh into seventy
years; who unlocks the casket of the human frame, and ranges
through its most secret chambers, until at last nothing, save the
mysterious germ of life itself, shall be hidden; who maps out all
the nations of the earth; showing how the sable Ethiopian, the
dusky Polynesian, the besotted Mongolian, the intellectual
European, are but differently developed exemplars of the same
type of manhood, and warning man that he is still his
&lsquo;brother&rsquo;s keeper&rsquo; now as in the primeval days
of Cain and Abel.</p>
<p><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>The
good genius, Science, it is who bears us on his d&aelig;dal wings
up into the starry night, there where &lsquo;God&rsquo;s name is
writ in worlds,&rsquo; and discourses to us of the laws which
bind the planets revolving around their planetary suns, and those
suns again circling for ever around the great central
sun&mdash;&lsquo;The Great White Throne of God!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The good genius, Science, it is who takes us back through the
long vista of years, and shows us this world of ours, this
beautiful world which the wisest and the best of us are so
unwilling to leave, first, as a vast drop of liquid lava-fire,
starting on that mysterious course which is to end only with time
itself; then, as a dark humid mass, &lsquo;without form and
void,&rsquo; where earth, sea, and sky, are mingled in
unutterable confusion; then, after countless, countless ages,
having grown to something like the thing of beauty the Creator
had intended, bringing forth the first embryonic germs of
vegetable life, to be succeeded, in due time, by gigantic trees
and towering ferns, compared with which the forest monarchs of
our day are veritable dwarfs; then, slowly, gradually, developing
the still greater wonder of animal life, from the primitive,
half-vegetable, half-conscious forms, till such mighty creatures
as the Megatherium, the Saurian, the Mammoth, the Iguanodon, roam
about the luxuriant forests, and bellow in chaotic caves, and
wallow in the teeming seas, and circle in the humid atmosphere,
making the earth rock and tremble beneath their monstrous
movements; then, last of all, the wonder of wonders, the climax
towards which the whole had been tending, the noblest and the
basest work of God&mdash;the creation of the thinking, reasoning,
sinning animal, Man.</p>
<p>And thus, gentlemen, will this good genius still go on,
instructing and improving, and purifying the human <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>mind, and
aiding in the grand work of developing the divinity within
it.&nbsp; I know, indeed, that it is a favourite argument of some
people that modern civilization will decline and vanish,
&lsquo;like the civilizations of old.&rsquo;&nbsp; But I venture
to deny it in toto.&nbsp; From a human point of view, it is
utterly impossible.&nbsp; And without going into the question
(for I see the time is running on) as to whether ancient
civilization really has passed away, or whether the old germ did
not rather spring into new life after the dark ages, and is now
bearing fruit, ten thousand times more glorious than it ever did
of old; without arguing this point, I contend that all
comparisons between ancient civilization and modern must of
necessity be futile and fallacious.&nbsp; And for this reason,
that independently of the civilizing effects of Christianity,
Science has knit the modern nations into one: whereas each nation
of antiquity had to work out its own problems of social and
political life, and come to its own conclusions.&nbsp; So
isolated, indeed, was one nation from another, that nations were
in some instances ignorant of each other&rsquo;s existence.&nbsp;
A new idea, or invention, born at Nineveh, was for Assyria alone;
at Athens, for Greece alone; at Rome, for Italy alone.&nbsp;
There was no science then to &lsquo;put a girdle round about the
earth&rsquo; (as Puck says) &lsquo;in forty minutes.&rsquo;&nbsp;
But now, a new idea brought to light in modern London, or Paris,
or New York, is for the whole world; it is wafted on the wings of
science around the whole habitable globe&mdash;from Ireland to
New Zealand, from India to Peru.&nbsp; I am not going to say,
gentlemen, that Britannia must always be the ruler of the
waves.&nbsp; The day may come that will see her sink to a
second-rate, a third-rate, or a fourth-rate power in
Europe.&nbsp; In spite of all we have been saying this evening,
the day may come that will see Russia the dominant power in
Europe.&nbsp; The <a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>day may come that will see Sydney and Melbourne the
fountain heads of refinement and learning.&nbsp; It may have been
ordained in Heaven at the first that each race upon the globe
shall be in its turn the dominant race&mdash;that the negro race
shall one day lord it over the Caucasian, as the Caucasian race
is now lording it over the negro.&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp; It would
be only equity.&nbsp; But I am not talking of races; I am not
talking of nationalities.&nbsp; I speak again of the great man,
Mankind&mdash;the one indivisible man that Science is making
him.&nbsp; He will never retrograde, because &lsquo;matter and
mind comprise the universe,&rsquo; and matter must entirely sink
beneath the weight of mind&mdash;because good must one day
conquer ill, or why was the world made?&nbsp; Henceforth his road
is onward&mdash;onward.&nbsp; Science has helped to give him such
a start that nothing shall hold him back&mdash;nothing can hold
him back&mdash;save a fiat, a direct fiat from the throne of
Almighty God.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I am wandering from the subject of the &lsquo;Old
House&rsquo; in Crown Street and its connection with
printing.&nbsp; The last important book that was ever printed
there was a very remarkable one.&nbsp; It was the famous essay on
Pantheism by Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s friend, the Rev. John Hunt,
D.D., at that time a curate of the St. Ives Church&mdash;a book
that was the result of an enormous amount of learning, research,
and original thought, a book, moreover, which has had a great
effect upon modern thought.&nbsp; It has passed through several
editions since it was printed at St. Ives in 1866.</p>

CHARACTERS IN THE MICROCOSM</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Craigie</span> has recently protested
against the metropolitan fable that London enjoys a monopoly of
culture, and has reminded us that in the provinces may be found a
great part of the intellectual energy of the nation.&nbsp; It
would be hard to find a more intellectual environment than that
in which Theodore Watts grew up.&nbsp; Indeed, his early life may
be compared to that of John Stuart Mill, although he escaped the
hardening and narrowing influences which marred the austere
educational system of the Mill family.&nbsp; Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s father was in many respects a very
remarkable man.&nbsp; &lsquo;He was,&rsquo; says the famous
gypsologist, F. H. Groome, in Chambers&rsquo;s
Encyclop&aelig;dia, &lsquo;a naturalist intimately connected with
Murchison, Lyell, and other geologists, a pre-Darwinian
evolutionist of considerable mark in the scientific world of
London, and the Gilbert White of the Ouse valley.&rsquo;&nbsp;
There is, as the &lsquo;Times&rsquo; said in its review of
&lsquo;Aylwin,&rsquo; so much of manifest Wahrheit mingled with
the Dichtung of the story, that it is not surprising that
attempts have often been made to identify all the
characters.&nbsp; Many of these guesses have been wrong; and
indeed, the only writer who has spoken with authority seems to be
Mr. Hake, who, in two papers in &lsquo;Notes and Queries&rsquo;
identified many of the characters.&nbsp; <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>Until he
wrote on the subject, it was generally assumed that the spiritual
protagonist from whom springs the entire action of the story,
Philip Aylwin, was Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s father.&nbsp; Mr.
Hake, however, tells us that this is not so.&nbsp; Philip Aylwin
is a portrait of the author&rsquo;s uncle, an extraordinary man
of whom I shall have something to say later.&nbsp; I feel myself
fortunate in having discovered an admirable account of Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s father in Mr. Norris&rsquo;s &lsquo;History
of St. Ives&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For many years one of the most interesting
of St. Ivian figures was the late Mr. J. K. Watts, who was born
at St. Ives in 1808, though his family on both sides came from
Hemingford Grey and Hemingford Abbots.&nbsp; According to the
following extracts from &lsquo;The Cambridge Chronicle and
University Journal&rsquo; of August 15, 1884, Mr. Watts died
quite suddenly on August 7 of that year: &lsquo;We record with
much regret the sudden death at Over of our townsman, Mr. J. K.
Watts, who died after an hour&rsquo;s illness of heart disease at
Berry House, whither he had been taken after the seizure.&nbsp;
Dr. J. Ellis, of Swavesey, was called in, but without
avail.&nbsp; At the inquest the post-mortem examination disclosed
that the cause of death was a long-standing fatty degeneration of
the heart, which had, on several occasions, resulted in
syncope.&nbsp; Deceased had been driven to Willingham and back to
Over upon a matter of business with Mr. Hawkes, and the extreme
heat of the weather seems to have acted as the proximate cause of
death.</p>
<p>Mr. Watts had practised in St. Ives from 1840, and was one of
the oldest solicitors in the county.&nbsp; He had also devoted
much time and study to scientific subjects, and was, in his
earlier life, a well-known figure in the <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>scientific
circles of London.&nbsp; He was for years connected with Section
E of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, and
elected on the Committee.&nbsp; He read papers on geology and
cognate subjects before that Association and other Societies
during the time that Murchison and Lyell were the apostles of
geology.&nbsp; Afterwards he made a special study of luminous
meteors, and in the Association&rsquo;s reports upon this subject
some of the most interesting observations of luminous meteors are
those recorded by Mr. Watts.&nbsp; He was one of the earliest
Fellows of the Geographical Society, and one of the Founders of
the Anthropological Society.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Watts never collected his papers and essays, but up to the
last moment of his life he gave attention to those subjects to
which he had devoted himself, as may be seen by referring to the
&lsquo;Antiquary&rsquo; for 1883 and 1884, where will be found
two articles on Cambridgeshire Antiquities, one of which did not
get into type till several months after his death.&nbsp; It was,
however, not by Arch&aelig;ology, but by his geological and
geographical writings that he made his reputation.&nbsp; And it
was these which brought him into contact with Murchison,
Livingstone, Lyell, Whewell, and Darwin, and also with the
geographers, some of whom, such as Du Chaillu, Findlay, Dr.
Norton Shaw, visited him at the Red House on the Market Hill, now
occupied by Mr. Matton.&nbsp; In the sketches of the life of Dr.
Latham it is mentioned that the famous ethnologist was a frequent
visitor to Mr. Watts at St. Ives.&nbsp; Since his death there
have been frequent references to him as a man of
&lsquo;encyclop&aelig;dic general knowledge.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was of an exceedingly retiring disposition, and few men in
St. Ives have been more liked or more generally respected.&nbsp;
His great delight seemed to be roaming <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>about in meadows and lanes observing
the changes of the vegetation and the bird and insect life in
which our neighbourhood is as rich as Selborne itself.&nbsp; On
such occasions the present writer has often met him and had many
interesting conversations with him upon subjects connected with
natural science.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With regard to the family of Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s mother,
the Duntons, although in the seventeenth century a branch of the
family lived in Huntingdonshire, some of them being clergymen
there for several generations, they are entirely East Anglian;
and some very romantic chapters in the history of the family have
been touched upon by Dr. Jessopp in his charming essay,
&lsquo;Ups and Downs of an Old Nunnery.&rsquo;&nbsp; This essay
was based upon a paper, communicated by Miss Mary Bateson to the
Norfolk and Norwich Arch&aelig;ological Society, and treating of
the Register of Crab House Nunnery.&nbsp; In 1896 Walter Theodore
Watts added his mother&rsquo;s to his father&rsquo;s name, by a
deed in Chancery.</p>
<p>I could not give a more pregnant instance of the difference in
temperament between a father and a son than by repeating a story
about Mr. Watts-Dunton which Rossetti (who was rich in anecdotes
of his friend) used to tell.&nbsp; When the future poet and
critic was a boy in jackets pursuing his studies at the Cambridge
school, he found in the school library a copy of Wells&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Stories after Nature,&rsquo; and read them with great
avidity.&nbsp; Shortly afterwards, when he had left school and
was reading all sorts of things, and also cultivating on the sly
a small family of Gryengroes encamped in the neighbourhood, he
was amazed to find, in a number of the &lsquo;Illuminated
Magazine,&rsquo; a periodical which his father, on account of
Douglas Jerrold, had taken in from the <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>first, one of the &lsquo;Stories
after Nature&rsquo; reprinted with an illustration by the
designer and engraver Linton.&nbsp; He said to his father,
&lsquo;Why, I have read this story before!&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;That is quite impossible,&rsquo; said his father,
&lsquo;quite impossible that you should have before read a new
story in a new number of a magazine.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I have
read it before; I know all about it,&rsquo; said the boy.&nbsp;
&lsquo;As I do not think you untruthful,&rsquo; said the father,
&lsquo;I think I can explain your hallucination about this
matter.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Do, father,&rsquo; said the
son.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the father, &lsquo;I do not
know whether or not you are a poet.&nbsp; But I do know that you
are a dreamer of dreams.&nbsp; You have told me before
extraordinary stories to the effect that when you see a landscape
that is new to you, it seems to you that you have seen it
before.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, father, that often
occurs.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, the reason for that is this, as
you will understand when you come to know a little more about
physiology.&nbsp; The brain is divided into two hemispheres,
exactly answering to each other, and they act so simultaneously
that they work like one brain; but it often happens that when
dreamers like you see things or read things, one of the
hemispheres has lapsed into a kind of drowsiness, and the other
one sees the object for itself; but in a second or two the lazy
hemisphere wakes up and thinks it has seen the picture
before.&rsquo;&nbsp; The explanation seemed convincing, and yet
it could not convince the boy.</p>
<p>The very next month the magazine gave another of the stories,
and the father said, &lsquo;Well, Walter, have you read this
before?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the boy falteringly,
&lsquo;unless, of course, it is all done by the double brain,
father.&rsquo;&nbsp; And so it went on from month to month.&nbsp;
When the boy had grown into a man and came to meet Rossetti, one
of the very first of the literary subjects <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>discussed
between them was that of Charles Wells&rsquo;s &lsquo;Joseph and
His Brethren&rsquo; and &lsquo;Stories after Nature.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Rossetti was agreeably surprised that although his new friend
knew nothing of &lsquo;Joseph and His Brethren,&rsquo; he was
very familiar with the &lsquo;Stories after Nature.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Mr. Watts-Dunton, &lsquo;they appeared
in the &ldquo;Illuminated Magazine.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Who should have thought,&rsquo; said Rossetti, &lsquo;that
the &ldquo;Illuminated Magazine&rdquo; in its moribund days, when
Linton took it up, should have got down to St. Ives.&nbsp; Its
circulation, I think, was only a few hundreds.&nbsp; Among
Linton&rsquo;s man&oelig;uvres for keeping the magazine alive was
to reprint and illustrate Charles Wells&rsquo;s &ldquo;Stories
after Nature&rdquo; without telling the public that they had
previously appeared in book form.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;They did
then appear in book form first?&rsquo; said Mr.
Watts-Dunton.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, but there can&rsquo;t have been
over a hundred or two sold,&rsquo; said Rossetti.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
discovered it at the British Museum.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I read
it at Cambridge in my school library,&rsquo; said Mr.
Watts-Dunton.&nbsp; It was the startled look on Rossetti&rsquo;s
face which caused Mr. Watts-Dunton to tell him the story about
his father and the &lsquo;Illuminated Magazine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was a necessity that a boy so reared should feel the
impulse to express himself in literature rather early.&nbsp; But
it will be new to many, and especially to the editor of the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um,&rsquo; that as a mere child he contributed
to its pages.&nbsp; When he was a boy he read the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um,&rsquo; which his father took in
regularly.&nbsp; One day he caught a correspondent of the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo;&mdash;no less a person than John P.
Collier&mdash;tripping on a point of Shakespearean scholarship,
being able to do so by chance.&nbsp; He had stumbled on the
matter in question while reading one of his father&rsquo;s
books.&nbsp; He wrote to the editor in his childish round hand,
stigmatizing the blunder <a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>with youthful scorn.&nbsp; In due
time the correction was noted in the Literary Gossip of the
journal.&nbsp; Soon after, his father had occasion to consult the
book, and finding a pencil mark opposite the passage, he said,
&lsquo;Walter, have you been marking this book?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Yes, father.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;But you know I
object?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, father, but I was interested in
the point.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said his father,
&lsquo;somebody has been writing about this very passage to the
&ldquo;Athen&aelig;um.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes,
father,&rsquo; replied the boy, red and ungrammatical with proud
confusion, &lsquo;it was me.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;You!&rsquo;
cried his astonished father, &lsquo;you!&rsquo;&nbsp; And thus
the matter was explained.&nbsp; Mr. Watts-Dunton confesses that
he was never tired of thumbing that, his first contribution to
the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Whatever may have been the influence of his father upon Mr.
Watts-Dunton, it was not, I think, nearly so great as that of his
uncle, James Orlando Watts.&nbsp; His father may have made him
scientific: his uncle seems to have made him philosophical with a
dash of mysticism.&nbsp; As I have already pointed out, Mr. Hake
has identified this uncle as the prototype of Philip Aylwin, the
father of the hero.&nbsp; The importance of this character in
&lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; is shown by the fact that, if we analyze the
story, we find that the character of Philip is its motive
power.&nbsp; After his death, everything that occurs is brought
about by his doctrines and his dreams, his fantasies and his
whims.&nbsp; This effect of making a man dominate from his grave
the entire course of the life of his descendants seems to be
unique in imaginative literature; and yet, although the fingers
of some critics (notably Mr. Coulson Kernahan) burn close to the
subject, there they leave it.&nbsp; What Mr. Watts-Dunton calls
&lsquo;the tragic mischief&rsquo; of the drama is not brought
about by any villain, but by the <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>vagaries and mystical speculations of
a dead man, the author of &lsquo;The Veiled Queen.&rsquo;&nbsp;
There were few things in which James Orlando Watts did not take
an interest.&nbsp; He was a deep student of the drama, Greek,
English, Spanish, and German.&nbsp; And it is a singular fact
that this dreamy man was a lover of the acted drama.&nbsp; One of
his stories in connection with acting is this.&nbsp; A party of
strolling players who went to St. Ives got permission to act for
a period in a vast stone-built barn, called Priory Barn, and
sometimes Cromwell&rsquo;s Barn.&nbsp; Mr. J. O. Watts went to
see them, and on returning home after the performance said,
&lsquo;I have seen a little actor who is a real genius.&nbsp; He
reminds me of what I have read about Edmund Kean&rsquo;s
acting.&nbsp; I shall go and see him every night.&nbsp; And he
went.&nbsp; The actor&rsquo;s name was Robson.&nbsp; When,
afterwards, Mr. Watts went to reside in London, he learnt that an
actor named Robson was acting in one of the second-rate theatres
called the Grecian Saloon.&nbsp; He went to the theatre and
found, as he expected, that it was the same actor who had so
impressed him down at St. Ives.&nbsp; From that time he followed
Robson to whatsoever theatre in London he went, and afterward
became a well-known figure among the playgoers of the
Olympic.&nbsp; He always contended that Robson was the only
histrionic genius of his time.&nbsp; Mr. Hake seems to have known
James Orlando Watts only after he had left St. Ives to live in
London:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He was,&rdquo; says Mr. Hake, &ldquo;a man
of extraordinary learning in the academic sense of the word, and
he possessed still more extraordinary general knowledge.&nbsp; He
lived for many years the strangest kind of hermit life,
surrounded by his books and old manuscripts.&nbsp; His two great
passions were philology and <a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>occultism, but he also took great
interest in rubbings from brass monuments.&nbsp; He knew more, I
think, of those strange writers discussed in Vaughan&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Hours with the Mystics&rsquo; than any other
person&mdash;including perhaps, Vaughan himself; but he managed
to combine with his love of mysticism a deep passion for the
physical sciences, especially astronomy.&nbsp; He seemed to be
learning languages up to almost the last year of his life.&nbsp;
His method of learning languages was the opposite of that of
George Borrow&mdash;that is to say, he made great use of
grammars; and when he died, it is said that from four to five
hundred treatises on grammar were found among his books.&nbsp; He
used to express great contempt for Borrow&rsquo;s method of
learning languages from dictionaries only.&nbsp; I do not think
that any one connected with literature&mdash;with the sole
exception of Mr. Swinburne, my father, and Dr. R. G.
Latham&mdash;knew so much of him as I did.&nbsp; His personal
appearance was exactly like that of Philip Aylwin, as described
in the novel.&nbsp; Although he never wrote poetry, he
translated, I believe, a good deal from the Spanish and
Portuguese poets.&nbsp; I remember that he was an extraordinary
admirer of Shelley.&nbsp; His knowledge of Shakespeare and the
Elizabethan dramatists was a link between him and Mr.
Swinburne.</p>
<p>At a time when I was a busy reader at the British Museum
reading room, I used frequently to see him, and he never seemed
to know anyone among the readers except myself, and whenever he
spoke to me it was always in a hushed whisper, lest he should
disturb the other readers, which in his eyes would have been a
heinous offence.&nbsp; For very many years he had been extremely
well known to the second-hand booksellers, for he was a constant
purchaser of their wares.&nbsp; He was a great pedestrian, and,
being very much attached to the north <a name="page59"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>of London, would take long, slow
tramps ten miles out in the direction of Highgate, Wood Green,
etc.&nbsp; I have a very distinct recollection of calling upon
him in Myddelton Square at the time when I was living close to
him in Percy Circus.&nbsp; Books were piled up from floor to
ceiling, apparently in great confusion; but he seemed to remember
where to find every book and what there was in it.&nbsp; It is a
singular fact that the only person outside those I have mentioned
who seems to have known him was that brilliant but eccentric
journalist, Thomas Purnell, who had an immense opinion of him and
used to call him &lsquo;the scholar.&rsquo;&nbsp; How Purnell
managed to break through the icy wall that surrounded the recluse
always puzzled me; but I suppose they must have come across one
another at one of those pleasant inns in the north of London
where &lsquo;the scholar&rsquo; was taking his chop and bottle of
Beaune.&nbsp; He was a man that never made new friends, and as
one after another of his old friends died he was left so entirely
alone that, I think, he saw no one except Mr. Swinburne, the
author of &lsquo;Aylwin,&rsquo; and myself.&nbsp; But at
Christmas he always spent a week at The Pines, when and where my
father and I used to meet him.&nbsp; His memory was so powerful
that he seemed to be able to recall, not only all that he had
read, but the very conversations in which he had taken a
part.&nbsp; He died, I think, at a little over eighty, and his
faculties up to the last were exactly like those of a man in the
prime of life.&nbsp; He always reminded me of Charles
Lamb&rsquo;s description of George Dyer.</p>
<p>Such is my outside picture of this extraordinary man; and it
is only of externals that I am free to speak here, even if I were
competent to touch upon his inner life.&nbsp; He was a still
greater recluse than the &lsquo;Philip Aylwin&rsquo; of the
novel.&nbsp; I think I am right in saying that <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>he took up
one or two Oriental tongues when he was seventy years of
age.&nbsp; Another of his passions was numismatics, and it was in
these studies that he sympathized with the author of
&lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo;s&rsquo; friend, the late Lord de
Tabley.&nbsp; I remember one story of his peculiarities which
will give an idea of the kind of man he was.&nbsp; He had a
brother, Mr. William K. Watts, who was the exact opposite of him
in every way&mdash;strikingly good-looking, with great charm of
manner and savoir faire, but with an ordinary intellect and a
very superficial knowledge of literature, or, indeed, anything
else, except records of British military and naval
exploits&mdash;where he was really learned.&nbsp; Being full of
admiration of his student brother, and having a parrot-like
instinct for mimicry, he used to talk with great volubility upon
all kinds of subjects wherever he went, and repeat in the same
words what he had been listening to from his brother, until at
last he got to be called the &lsquo;walking
encyclop&aelig;dia.&rsquo;&nbsp; The result was that he got the
reputation of being a great reader and an original thinker, while
the true student and book-lover was frequently complimented on
the way in which he took after his learned brother.&nbsp; This
did not in the least annoy the real student, it simply amused
him, and he would give with a dry humour most amusing stories as
to what people had said to him on this subject.&rdquo; <a
name="citation60"></a><a href="#footnote60"
class="citation">[60]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Balzac might have made this singular anecdote the nucleus of
one of his stories.&nbsp; I may add that the editor of
&lsquo;Notes and Queries,&rsquo; Mr. Joseph Knight, knew James
Orlando Watts, and he has stated that he &lsquo;can testify to
the truth&rsquo; of Mr. Hake&rsquo;s
&lsquo;portraiture.&rsquo;</p>

EARLY GLIMPSES OF THE GYPSIES</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> an East Midlander by birth
it seems to have been to East Anglia that Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s sympathies were most strongly drawn.&nbsp;
It was there that he first made acquaintance with the sea, and it
was to East Anglia that his gypsy friends belonged.</p>
<p>On the East Anglian side of St. Ives, opposite to the
Hemingford side already described, the country, though not so
lovely as the western side, is at first fairly attractive; but it
becomes less and less so as it nears the Fens.&nbsp; The Fens,
however, would seem to have a charm of their own, and Mr.
Watts-Dunton himself has described them with a vividness that
could hardly be surpassed.&nbsp; It was here as a boy that he
made friends with the Gryengroes&mdash;that superior variety of
the Romanies which Borrow had known years before.&nbsp; These
gypsies used to bring their Welsh ponies to England and sell them
at the fairs.&nbsp; I must now go back for some years in order to
enrich my pages with Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s graphic description
of his first meeting with the gypsies in the Fen country, which
appeared in &lsquo;Great Thoughts&rsquo; in 1903.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I shall never forget my earliest
recollections of them.&nbsp; My father used sometimes to drive in
a dogcart to see friends of his through about twelve miles of Fen
country, <a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>and he used to take me with him.&nbsp; Let me say that
the Fen country is much more striking than is generally
supposed.&nbsp; Instead of leafy quick hedgerows, as in the
midlands, or walls, as in the north country, the fields are
divided by dykes; not a tree is to be seen in some parts for
miles and miles.&nbsp; This gives an importance to the skies such
as is observed nowhere else except on the open sea.&nbsp; The
flashing opalescent radiance of the sea is apt to challenge the
riches of the sky, and in a certain degree tends to neutralize
it; but in the Fen country the level, monotonous greenery of the
crops in summer, and, in autumn and winter, the vast expanse of
black earth, make the dome of the sky, by contrast, so bright and
glorious that in cloudless weather it gleams and suggests a roof
of rainbows; and in cloudy weather it seems almost the only
living sight in the universe, and becomes thus more magical
still.&nbsp; And as to sunsets, I do not know of any, either by
land or sea, to be compared with the sunsets to be seen in the
Fen country.&nbsp; The humidity of the atmosphere has, no doubt,
a good deal to do with it.&nbsp; The sun frequently sets in a
pageantry of gauzy vapour of every colour, quite
indescribable.</p>
<p>The first evening that I took one of these drives, while I was
watching the wreaths of blue curling smoke from countless heaps
of twitch-grass, set burning by the farm-labourers, which
stretched right up to the sky-line, my father pulled up the
dogcart and pointed to a ruddy fire glowing, flickering, and
smoking in an angle where a green grassy drove-way met the
dark-looking high-road some yards ahead.&nbsp; And then I saw
some tents, and then a number of dusky figures, some squatting
near the fire, some moving about.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
gypsies!&rsquo; I said, in the greatest state of exultation,
which soon fled, however, when I heard a shrill whistle and saw a
lot of these dusky <a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>people running and leaping like wild things towards the
dog-cart.&nbsp; &lsquo;Will they kill us, father?&rsquo; I
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Kill us?&nbsp; No,&rsquo; he said, laughing;
&lsquo;they are friends of mine.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve only come to
lead the mare past the fire and keep her from shying at
it.&rsquo;&nbsp; They came flocking up.&nbsp; So far from the
mare starting, as she would have done at such an invasion by
English people, she seemed to know and welcome the gypsies by
instinct, and seemed to enjoy their stroking her nose with their
tawny but well-shaped fingers, and caressing her neck.&nbsp;
Among them was one of the prettiest little gypsy girls I ever
saw.&nbsp; When the gypsies conducted us past their camp I was
fascinated by the charm of the picture.&nbsp; Outside the tents
in front of the fire, over which a kettle was suspended from an
upright iron bar, which I afterwards knew as the kettle-prop, was
spread a large dazzling white table-cloth, covered with white
crockery, among which glittered a goodly number of silver
spoons.&nbsp; I afterwards learnt that to possess good linen,
good crockery, and real silver spoons, was as &lsquo;passionate a
desire in the Romany chi as in the most ambitious farmer&rsquo;s
wife in the Fen country.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was from this little
incident that my intimacy with the gypsies dated.&nbsp; I
associated much with them in after life, and I have had more
experiences among them than I have yet had an opportunity of
recording in print.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This pretty gypsy girl was the prototype, I believe, of the
famous Rhona Boswell herself.</p>
<p>It must of course have been after the meeting with Rhona in
the East Midlands&mdash;supposing always that we are allowed to
identify the novelist with the hero, a bold
supposition&mdash;that Mr. Watts-Dunton again came across
her&mdash;this time in East Anglia.&nbsp; Whether this is so or
not, I must give this picture of her from
&lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>&ldquo;It was at this time that I made the acquaintance
of Winnie&rsquo;s friend, Rhona Boswell, a charming little Gypsy
girl.&nbsp; Graylingham Wood and Rington Wood, like the entire
neighbourhood, were favourite haunts of a superior kind of
Gypsies called Gryengroes, that is to say, horse-dealers.&nbsp;
Their business was to buy ponies in Wales and sell them in the
Eastern Counties and the East Midlands.&nbsp; Thus it was that
Winnie had known many of the East Midland Gypsies in Wales.&nbsp;
Compared with Rhona Boswell, who was more like a fairy than a
child, Winnie seemed quite a grave little person.&nbsp;
Rhona&rsquo;s limbs were always on the move, and the movement
sprang always from her emotions.&nbsp; Her laugh seemed to ring
through the woods like silver bells, a sound that it was
impossible to mistake for any other.&nbsp; The laughter of most
Gypsy girls is full of music and of charm, and yet Rhona&rsquo;s
laughter was a sound by itself, and it was no doubt this which
afterwards, when she grew up, attracted my kinsman, Percy Aylwin,
towards her.&nbsp; It seemed to emanate, not from her throat
merely, but from her entire frame.&nbsp; If one could imagine a
strain of merriment and fun blending with the ecstatic notes of a
skylark soaring and singing, one might form some idea of the
laugh of Rhona Boswell.&nbsp; Ah, what days they were!&nbsp;
Rhona would come from Gypsy Dell, a romantic place in Rington
Manor, some miles off, especially to show us some newly devised
coronet of flowers that she had been weaving for herself.&nbsp;
This induced Winnie to weave for herself a coronet of seaweeds,
and an entire morning was passed in grave discussion as to which
coronet excelled the other.&rdquo;</p>

65</span>Chapter VI<br />
SPORT AND WORK</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was at this period that, like so
many young Englishmen who were his contemporaries, he gave
attention to field sports, and took interest in that athleticism
which, to judge from Wilkie Collins&rsquo;s scathing pictures,
was quite as rampant and absurd then as it is in our own
time.&nbsp; It was then too that he acquired that familiarity
with the figures prominent in the ring which startles one in his
reminiscences of George Borrow.&nbsp; But it will scarcely
interest the readers of this book to dwell long upon this
subject.&nbsp; Nor have I time to repeat the humorous stories I
have heard him tell about the queer characters who could then be
met at St. Ives Fair (said to have been the largest cattle fair
in England), and at another favourite resort of his, Stourbridge
Fair, near Cambridge.&nbsp; Stourbridge Fair still exists, but
its glory was departing when Mr. Watts-Dunton was familiar with
it; and now, possibly, it has departed for ever.&nbsp; Of
Cambridge and the entire county he tells many anecdotes.&nbsp;
Here is a specimen:&mdash;</p>
<p>Once in the early sixties he and his brother and some friends
were greatly exercised by the news that Deerfoot, the famous
American Indian runner in whom Borrow took such an interest, was
to run at Cambridge against the English champion.&nbsp; When the
day came, they drove to Cambridge in a dog-cart from St. Ives,
about a <a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>dozen miles.&nbsp; The race took place in a field called
Fenner&rsquo;s Ground, much used by cricketers.&nbsp; This is
how, as far as I can recall the words, he tells the
anecdote:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The place was crammed with all sorts of
young men&mdash;&rsquo;varsity men and others.&nbsp; There were
not many young farmers or squires or yeomen within a radius of a
good many miles that did not put in an appearance on that
occasion.&nbsp; The Indian won easily, and at the conclusion of
the race there was a frantic rush to get near him and shake his
hand.&nbsp; The rush was so wild and so insensate that it
irritated me more than I should at the present moment consider it
possible to be irritated.&nbsp; But I ought to say that at that
time of my life I had developed into a strangely imperious little
chap.&nbsp; I had been over-indulged&mdash;not at home, but at
the Cambridge school to which I had been sent&mdash;and
spoilt.&nbsp; This seems odd, but it&rsquo;s true.&nbsp; It was
the boys who spoilt me in a curious way&mdash;a way which will
not be understood by those who went to public schools like Eton,
where the fagging principle would have stood in the way of the
development of the curious relation between me and my
fellow-pupils which I am alluding to.&nbsp; There is an
inscrutable form of the monarchic instinct in the genus homo
which causes boys, without in the least knowing why, to select
one boy as a kind of leader, or rather emperor, and spoil him,
almost unfit him indeed for that sense of equality which is so
valuable in the social struggle for life that follows
school-days.&nbsp; This kind of emperor I had been at that
school.&nbsp; It indicated no sort of real superiority on my
part; for I learnt that immediately after I had left the vacant
post it was filled by another boy&mdash;filled for an equally
inscrutable reason.&nbsp; The result of it was that I became (as
I often think when I recall <a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>those days) the most masterful young
urchin that ever lived.&nbsp; If I had not been so, I could not
have got into a fury at being jostled by a good-humoured
crowd.&nbsp; My brother, who had not been so spoilt at school,
was very different, and kept urging me to keep my temper.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s capital fun,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;look at
this blue-eyed young chap jostling and being jostled close to
us.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s fond of a hustle, and no mistake.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s the kind of chap I should like to know&rsquo;; and
he indicated a young &rsquo;varsity man of whose elbow at that
moment I was unpleasantly conscious, and who seemed to be in a
state of delight at other elbows being pushed into his
ribs.&nbsp; I soon perceived that certain men whom he was with
seemed angry, not on their own account, but on account of this
youth of the laughing lips and blue eyes.&nbsp; As they were
trying to make a ring round him, &lsquo;Hanged if it isn&rsquo;t
the Prince!&rsquo; said my brother.&nbsp; &lsquo;And look how he
takes it!&nbsp; Surely you can stand what he stands!&rsquo;&nbsp;
It was, in fact, the Prince of Wales, who had come to see the
American runner.&nbsp; I needed only two or three years of
buffeting with the great life outside the schoolroom to lose all
my imperiousness and learn the essential lesson of
give-and-take.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a time Mr. Watts-Dunton wavered about being articled to
his father as a solicitor.&nbsp; His love of the woods and fields
was too great at that time for him to find life in a
solicitor&rsquo;s office at all tolerable.&nbsp; Moreover, it
would seem that he who had been so precocious a student, and who
had lived in books, felt a temporary revulsion from them, and an
irresistible impulse to study Nature apart from books, to study
her face to face.&nbsp; And it was at this time that, as the
&lsquo;Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica&rsquo; remarks, he
&lsquo;moved much among the East Anglian gypsies, of whose
superstitions and folklore he <a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>made a careful study.&rsquo;&nbsp;
But of this period of his life I have but little knowledge.&nbsp;
Judging from Groome&rsquo;s remarks upon &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; in
the &lsquo;Bookman,&rsquo; he alone had Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s
full confidence in the matter.&nbsp; So great was his desire to
pore over the book of nature, there appears to have been some
likelihood, perhaps I ought to say some danger, of his feeling
the impulse which had taken George Borrow away from
civilization.&nbsp; He seems, besides, to have shared with the
Greeks and with Montaigne a belief in the value of leisure.&nbsp;
It was at this period, to judge from his writings, that he
exclaimed with Montaigne, &lsquo;Have you known how to regulate
your conduct, you have done a great deal more than he who has
composed books.&nbsp; Have you known how to take repose, you have
done more than he who has taken empires and cities.&rsquo;&nbsp;
I suppose, however, that this was the time when he composed that
unpublished &lsquo;Dictionary for Nature-worshippers,&rsquo; from
which he often used to quote in the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um.&rsquo;&nbsp; There is nothing in his
writings so characteristic as those definitions.&nbsp; Work and
Sport are thus defined: &lsquo;Work: that activity of mind or
body which exhausts the vital forces without yielding pleasure or
health to the individual.&nbsp; Sport: that activity of mind or
body which, in exhausting the vital forces, yields pleasure and
health to the individual.&nbsp; The activity, however severe, of
a born artist at his easel, of a born poet at his rhymings, of a
born carpenter at his plane, is sport.&nbsp; The activity,
however slight, of the born artist or poet at the
merchant&rsquo;s desk, is work.&nbsp; Hence, to work is not to
pray.&nbsp; We have called the heresy of Work modern because it
is the characteristic one of our time; but, alas! like all
heresies, it is old.&nbsp; It was preached by Zoroaster in almost
Mr. Carlyle&rsquo;s words when Concord itself was in the woods
and ere Chelsea was.&rsquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>In one
of his books Mr. Watts-Dunton writes with great eloquence upon
this subject:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;How hateful is the word
&lsquo;experience&rsquo; in the mouth of the
litt&eacute;rateur.&nbsp; They all seem to think that this
universe exists to educate them, and that they should write books
about it.&nbsp; They never look on a sunrise without thinking
what an experience it is; how it is educating them for
bookmaking.&nbsp; It is this that so often turns the true
Nature-worshipper away from books altogether, that makes him
bless with what at times seems such malicious fervour those two
great benefactors of the human race, Caliph Omar and
Warburton&rsquo;s cook.</p>
<p>In Thoreau there was an almost perpetual warring of the Nature
instinct with the Humanity instinct.&nbsp; And, to say the truth,
the number is smaller than even Nature-worshippers themselves are
aware&mdash;those in whom there is not that warring of these two
great primal instincts.&nbsp; For six or eight months at a time
there are many, perhaps, who could revel in &lsquo;utter
solitude,&rsquo; as companionship with Nature is called; with no
minster clock to tell them the time of day, but, instead, the
bleating of sheep and the lowing of cattle in the morning, the
shifting of the shadows at noon, and the cawing of rooks going
home at sunset.&nbsp; But then to these, there comes suddenly,
and without the smallest warning, a half-recognized but secretly
sweet pleasure in looking at the smooth high-road, and thinking
that it leads to the city&mdash;a beating of the heart at the
sound of the distant railway-whistle, as the train winds its way,
like a vast gliding snake, to the whirlpool they have left.</p>
<p>In order to realize the folly of the modern Carlylean heresy
of work, it is necessary to realize fully how infinitely rich is
Nature, and how generous, and consequently <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>what a sacred
duty as well as wise resolve it is that, before he &lsquo;returns
unto the ground,&rsquo; man should drink deeply while he may at
the fountain of Life.&nbsp; Let it be enough for the
Nature-worshipper to know that he, at least, has been
blessed.&nbsp; Suppose he were to preach in London or Paris or
New York against this bastard civilization, and expatiate on
Nature&rsquo;s largess, of which it robs us?&nbsp; Suppose he
were to say to people to whom opinion is the breath of life,
&lsquo;What is it that this civilization of yours can give you by
way of compensation for that of which it robs you?&nbsp; Is it
your art?&nbsp; Is it your literature?&nbsp; Is it your
music?&nbsp; Is it your science?&rsquo;&nbsp; Suppose, for
instance, he were to say to the collector of Claudes, or Turners,
or David Coxes: &lsquo;Your possessions are precious undoubtedly,
but what are even they when set against the tamest and quietest
sunrise, in the tamest and quietest district of Cambridge or
Lincoln, in this tame and quiet month, when, over the treeless
flat you may see, and for nothing, purple bar after purple bar
trembling along the grey, as the cows lift up their heads from
the sheet of silver mist in which they are lying?&nbsp; How can
you really enjoy your Turners, you who have never seen a sunrise
in your lives?&rsquo;&nbsp; Or suppose he were to say to the
opera-goer: &lsquo;Those notes of your favourite soprano were
superb indeed; and superb they ought to be to keep you in the
opera-house on a June night, when all over the south of England a
thousand thickets, warm with the perfumed breath of the summer
night, are musical with the gurgle of the
nightingales.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thoreau preached after this fashion,
and was deservedly laughed at for his pains.</p>
<p>Yet it is not a little singular that this heresy of the
sacredness of work should be most flourishing at the very time
when the sophism on which it was originally built <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>is exploded;
the sophism, we mean, that Nature herself is the result of Work,
whereas she is the result of growth.&nbsp; One would have thought
that this was the very time for recognizing what the sophism had
blinded us to, that Nature&rsquo;s permanent
temper&mdash;whatever may be said of this or that mood of
hers&mdash;is the temper of Sport, that her pet abhorrence, which
is said to be a vacuum, is really Work.&nbsp; We see this clearly
enough in what are called the lower animals&mdash;whether it be a
tiger or a gazelle, a ferret or a coney, a bat or a
butterfly&mdash;the final cause of the existence of every
conscious thing is that it should sport.&nbsp; It has no other
use than that.&nbsp; For this end it was that &lsquo;the great
Vishnu yearned to create a world.&rsquo;&nbsp; Yet over the
toiling and moiling world sits Moloch Work; while those whose
hearts are withering up with hatred of him are told by certain
writers to fall down before him and pretend to love.</p>
<p>The worker of the mischief is, of course, civilization in
excess, or rather, civilization in wrong directions.&nbsp; For
this word, too, has to be newly defined in the Dictionary before
mentioned, where you will find it thus given:&mdash;Civilization:
a widening and enriching of human life.&nbsp; Bastard or Modern
Western Civilization: the art of inventing fictitious wants and
working to supply them.&nbsp; In bastard civilization life
becomes poorer and poorer, paltrier and paltrier, till at last
life goes out of fashion altogether, and is supplanted by
work.&nbsp; True freedom is more remote from us than ever.&nbsp;
For modern Freedom is thus defined: the exchange of the slavery
of feudality for the slavery of opinion.&nbsp; Thoreau realized
this, and tried to preach men back to common-sense and
Nature.&nbsp; Here was his mistake&mdash;in trying to
preach.&nbsp; No man ever yet had the Nature-instinct preached
into him.&rdquo;</p>

EAST ANGLIA</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Whatever</span> may have been those
experiences with the gryengroes which made Groome, when speaking
of the gypsies of &lsquo;Aylwin,&rsquo; say &lsquo;the author
writes only of what he knows,&rsquo; it seems to have been after
his intercourse with the gypsies that he and a younger brother,
Alfred Eugene Watts (elsewhere described), were articled as
solicitors to their father.&nbsp; His bent, however, was always
towards literature, especially poetry, of which he had now
written a great deal&mdash;indeed, the major part of the volume
which was destined to lie unpublished for so many years.&nbsp;
But before I deal with the most important period of Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s life&mdash;his life in London&mdash;it seems
necessary to say a word or two about his visits to East Anglia,
and especially to the Norfolk coast.&nbsp; There are some
admirable remarks upon the East Coast in Mr. William
Sharp&rsquo;s chapter on &lsquo;Aylwinland&rsquo; in
&lsquo;Literary Geography,&rsquo; and he notes the way in which
Rhona Boswell links it with Cowslip Land; but he does not give
examples of the poems which thus link it, such as the double
roundel called &lsquo;The Golden Hand.&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><a

Dark eyes that pictures in the sky expand:<br />
Love-lips (with one tattoo &lsquo;for dukkerin&rsquo; <a

<p>Blest &lsquo;Golden Hand&rsquo;!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the same way that the velvety green of Hunts is seen in the
verses I have already quoted, so the softer side of the inland
scenery of East Anglia is described in the following lines, where
also we find an exquisite use of the East Anglian fancy about the
fairies and the foxglove bells.</p>
<p>At a waltz during certain Venetian revels after the liberation
from the Austrian yoke, a forsaken lover stands and watches a
lady whose child-love he had won in England:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Has she forgotten for such halls as these<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The domes the angels built in holy times,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When wings were ours in childhood&rsquo;s flowery
climes<br />
To dance with butterflies and golden bees?&mdash;<br />
Forgotten how the sunny-fingered breeze<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shook out those English harebells&rsquo; magic
chimes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On that child-wedding morn, &rsquo;neath English
limes,<br />
&rsquo;Mid wild-flowers tall enough to kiss her knees?</p>
<p>The love that childhood cradled&mdash;girlhood
nursed&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Has she forgotten it for this dull play,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where far-off pigmies seem to waltz and sway<br />
Like dancers in a telescope reversed?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or does not pallid Conscience come and say,<br />
&lsquo;Who sells her glory of beauty stands accursed&rsquo;?</p>
<p>But was it this that bought her&mdash;this poor splendour<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; That won her from her troth and wild-flower
wreath<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who &lsquo;cracked the foxglove bells&rsquo; on
Grayland Heath,<br />
<a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>Or played
with playful winds that tried to bend her,<br />
Or, tripping through the deer-park, tall and slender,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Answered the larks above, the crakes beneath,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or mocked, with glitter of laughing lips and
teeth,<br />
When Love grew grave&mdash;to hide her soul&rsquo;s
surrender?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Sharp has dwelt upon the striking way in which the scenery
and atmosphere are rendered in &lsquo;Aylwin,&rsquo; but this, as
I think, is even more clearly seen in the poems.&nbsp; And in
none of these is it seen so vividly as in that exhilarating poem,
&lsquo;Gypsy Heather,&rsquo; published in the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um,&rsquo; and not yet garnered in a
volume.&nbsp; This poem also shows his lyrical power, which never
seems to be at its very best unless he is depicting Romany life
and Romany passion.&nbsp; The metre of this poem is as original
as that of &lsquo;The Gypsy Haymaking Song,&rsquo; quoted in an
earlier chapter.&nbsp; It has a swing like that of no other
poem:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">GYPSY HEATHER</p>

man it&rsquo;ll show him the selfsame heather where it wur

<p>[Percy Aylwin, standing on the deck of the
&lsquo;Petrel,&rsquo; takes from his pocket a letter which,
before he had set sail to return to the south seas, the Melbourne
post had brought him&mdash;a letter from Rhona, staying then with
the Boswells on a patch of heath much favoured by the Boswells,
called &lsquo;Gypsy Heather.&rsquo;&nbsp; He takes from the
envelope a withered heather-spray, encircled by a little scroll
of paper on which Rhona has written the words, &lsquo;Remember
Gypsy Heather.&rsquo;]</p>

The hot sea holds each sight, each sound<br />

Dear girl, this spray between the leaves<br />

The sea-wind seems an English breeze<br />

<p>Another reason that makes it necessary for me to touch upon
the inland part of East Anglia is that I have certain remarks to
make upon what are called &lsquo;the Omarian poems of Mr.
Watts-Dunton.&rsquo;&nbsp; Although, as I have before hinted, St.
Ives, being in Hunts, belongs topographically to the East
Midlands, its sympathies are East Anglian.&nbsp; This perhaps is
partly because it is the extreme <a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>east of Hunts, and partly because the
mouth of the Ouse is at Lynn: to those whom Mr. Norris
affectionately calls St. Ivians and Hemingfordians, the seaside
means Yarmouth, Lowestoft, Cromer, Hunstanton, and the towns on
the Suffolk coast.&nbsp; The splendour of Norfolk ale may also
partly account for it.&nbsp; This perhaps also explains why the
famous East Anglian translator of Omar Khayy&agrave;m would seem
to have been known to a few Omarians on the banks of the Ouse and
Cam as soon as the great discoverer of good things, Rossetti,
pounced upon it in the penny box of a second-hand
bookseller.&nbsp; Readers of Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s obituary
notice of F. H. Groome in the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; will
recall these words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It was not merely upon Romany subjects that
Groome found points of sympathy at &lsquo;The Pines&rsquo; during
that first luncheon; there was that other subject before
mentioned, Edward FitzGerald and Omar Khayy&agrave;m.&nbsp; We, a
handful of Omarians of those antediluvian days, were perhaps all
the more intense in our cult because we believed it to be
esoteric.&nbsp; And here was a guest who had been brought into
actual personal contact with the wonderful old
&lsquo;Fitz.&rsquo;&nbsp; As a child of eight he had seen him,
talked with him, been patted on the head by him.&nbsp;
Groome&rsquo;s father, the Archdeacon of Suffolk, was one of
FitzGerald&rsquo;s most intimate friends.&nbsp; This was at once
a delightful and a powerful link between Frank Groome and those
at the luncheon table; and when he heard, as he soon did, the
toast to &lsquo;Omar Khayy&agrave;m,&rsquo; none drank that toast
with more gusto than he.&nbsp; The fact is, as the Romanies say,
true friendship, like true love, is apt to begin at first
sight.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the poem alluded to: it is entitled, &lsquo;Toast to
Omar Khayy&agrave;m: An East Anglian echo-chorus inscribed <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>to old

<p>It was many years after this&mdash;it was as a member of
another Omar Khayy&agrave;m Club of much greater celebrity than
the little brotherhood of Ouse and Cam&mdash;not large enough to
be called a club&mdash;that Mr. Watts-Dunton wrote the following
well-known sonnet:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">PRAYER TO THE WINDS</p>
<p>On planting at the head of FitzGerald&rsquo;s grave two
rose-trees whose ancestors had scattered their petals over the
tomb of Omar Khayy&agrave;m.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My tomb shall be on a spot where the north wind may
strow roses upon it.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Omar
Khayy&agrave;m to Kw&aacute;jah Nizami</span>.</p>
<p>Hear us, ye winds!&nbsp; From where the north-wind strows<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Blossoms that crown &lsquo;the King of
Wisdom&rsquo;s&rsquo; tomb,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The trees here planted bring remembered bloom,<br />
Dreaming in seed of Love&rsquo;s ancestral rose,<br />
To meadows where a braver north-wind blows<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er greener grass, o&rsquo;er hedge-rose,
may, and broom,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And all that make East England&rsquo;s
field-perfume<br />
Dearer than any fragrance Persia knows.</p>
<p>Hear us, ye winds, North, East, and West, and South!<br />
This granite covers him whose golden mouth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Made wiser ev&rsquo;n the Word of Wisdom&rsquo;s
King:<br />
Blow softly over Omar&rsquo;s Western herald<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till roses rich of Omar&rsquo;s dust shall spring<br
/>
From richer dust of Suffolk&rsquo;s rare FitzGerald.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I must now quote another of Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s East
Anglian poems, partly because it depicts the weird charm of the
Norfolk coast, and partly because it illustrates that sympathy
between the poet and the lower <a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>animals which I have already
noted.&nbsp; I have another reason: not long ago, that good East
Anglian, Mr. Rider Haggard interested us all by telling how
telepathy seemed to have the power of operating between a dog and
its beloved master in certain rare and extraordinary cases.&nbsp;
When the poem appeared in the &lsquo;Saturday Review&rsquo;
(December 20, 1902), it was described as &lsquo;part of a
forthcoming romance.&rsquo;&nbsp; It records a case of telepathy
between man and dog quite as wonderful as that narrated by Mr.
Rider Haggard:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">CAUGHT IN THE EBBING
TIDE</p>
<p>The mightiest Titan&rsquo;s stroke could not withstand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; An ebbing tide like this.&nbsp; These swirls

<p>In these days when so much is written about the intelligence
of the lower animals, when &lsquo;Hans,&rsquo; the
&lsquo;thinking horse,&rsquo; is &lsquo;interviewed&rsquo; by
eminent scientists, the exploit of the Second Gelert is not
without interest.&nbsp; I may, perhaps, mention a strange
experience of my own.&nbsp; The late Betts Bey, a well-known
figure in St. Peter&rsquo;s Port, Guernsey, had a fine black
retriever, named Caro.&nbsp; During a long summer holiday which
we spent in Guernsey, Caro became greatly attached to a friend,
and Betts Bey presented him to her.&nbsp; He was a magnificent
fellow, <a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>valiant as a lion, and a splendid diver and
swimmer.&nbsp; He often plunged off the parapet of the bridge
which spans the Serpentine.&nbsp; Indeed, he would have dived
from any height.&nbsp; His intelligence was surprising.&nbsp; If
we wished to make him understand that he was not to accompany us,
we had only to say, &lsquo;Caro, we are going to
church!&rsquo;&nbsp; As soon as he heard the word
&lsquo;church&rsquo; his barks would cease, his tail would drop,
and he would look mournfully resigned.&nbsp; One evening, as I
was writing in my room, Caro began to scratch outside the door,
uttering those strange &lsquo;woof-woofs&rsquo; which were his
canine language.&nbsp; I let him in, but he would not rest.&nbsp;
He stood gazing at me with an intense expression, and, turning
towards the door, waited impatiently.&nbsp; For some time I took
no notice of his dumb appeal, but his excitement increased, and
suddenly a vague sense of ill seemed to pass from him into my
mind.&nbsp; Drawn half-consciously I rose, and at once with a
strange half-human whine Caro dashed upstairs.&nbsp; I followed
him.&nbsp; He ran into a bedroom, and there in the dark I found
my friend lying unconscious.&nbsp; It is well-nigh certain that
Caro thus saved my friend&rsquo;s life.</p>

87</span>Chapter VIII<br />
LONDON</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Between</span> Mr. Watts-Dunton and the
brother who came next to him, before mentioned, there was a very
great affection, although the difference between them, mentally
and physically, was quite noticeable.&nbsp; They were articled to
their father on the same day and admitted solicitors on the same
day, a very unusual thing with solicitors and their sons.&nbsp;
Mr. Watts-Dunton afterwards passed a short term in one of the
great conveyancing offices in London in order to become
proficient in conveyancing.&nbsp; His brother did the same in
another office in Bedford Row; but he afterwards practised for
himself.&nbsp; Mr. A. E. Watts soon had a considerable practice
as family solicitor and conveyancer.&nbsp; Mr. Hake identifies
him with Cyril Aylwin, but before I quote Mr. Hake&rsquo;s
interesting account of him, I will give the vivid description of
Cyril in &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Juvenile curls clustered thick and short
beneath his wideawake.&nbsp; He had at first struck me as being
not much more than a lad, till, as he gave me that rapid,
searching glance in passing, I perceived the little crow&rsquo;s
feet round his eyes, and he then struck me immediately as being
probably on the verge of thirty-five.&nbsp; His figure was slim
and thin, his waist almost girlish in its fall.&nbsp; I should
have considered him small, had not the unusually deep, loud,
manly, and sonorous voice with which he had <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>accosted
Sinfi conveyed an impression of size and weight such as even big
men do not often produce.&nbsp; This deep voice, coupled with
that gaunt kind of cheek which we associate with the most demure
people, produced an effect of sedateness . . . but in the one
glance I had got from those watchful, sagacious, twinkling eyes,
there was an expression quite peculiar to them, quite
inscrutable, quite indescribable.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cyril Aylwin was at first thought to be a portrait of
Whistler, which is not quite so outrageously absurd as the wild
conjecture that William Morris was the original of
Wilderspin.&nbsp; Mr. Hake says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I am especially able to speak of this
character, who has been inquired about more than any other in the
book.&nbsp; I knew him, I think, even before I knew Rossetti and
Morris, or any of that group.&nbsp; He was a brother of Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s&mdash;Mr. Alfred Eugene Watts.&nbsp; He
lived at Sydenham, and died suddenly, either in 1870 or 1871,
very shortly after I had met him at a wedding party.&nbsp; Among
the set in which I moved at that time he had a great reputation
as a wit and humorist.&nbsp; His style of humour always struck me
as being more American than English.&nbsp; While bringing out
humorous things that would set a dinner table in a roar, he would
himself maintain a perfectly unmoved countenance.&nbsp; And it
was said of him, as &lsquo;Wilderspin&rsquo; says of &lsquo;Cyril
Aylwin,&rsquo; that he was never known to laugh.&rdquo; <a
name="citation88"></a><a href="#footnote88"
class="citation">[88]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After a time Mr. Watts-Dunton joined his brother, and the two
practised together in London.&nbsp; They also lived together at
Sydenham.&nbsp; Some time after this, however, <a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>Mr.
Watts-Dunton determined to abandon the law for literature.&nbsp;
The brothers migrated to Sydenham, because at that time Mr.
Watts-Dunton pursued music with an avidity and interest which
threatened for a time to interfere with those literary energies
which it was now his intention to exercise.&nbsp; At that time
the orchestral concerts at the Crystal Palace under Manns, given
every morning and every afternoon, were a great attraction to
music lovers, and Mr. Watts-Dunton, who lived close by, rarely
missed either the morning or the afternoon concert.&nbsp; It was
in this way that he became steeped in German music; and
afterwards, when he became intimate with Dr. F. Hueffer, the
musical critic of the &lsquo;Times,&rsquo; and the exponent of
Wagner in Great Britain, he became a thorough Wagnerian.</p>
<p>It was during this time, and through the extraordinary social
attractions of his brother, that Mr. Watts-Dunton began to move
very much in London life, and saw a great deal of what is called
London society.&nbsp; After his brother&rsquo;s death he took
chambers in Great James Street, close to Mr. Swinburne, with whom
he had already become intimate.&nbsp; And according to Mr. Hake,
in his paper in &lsquo;T. P.&rsquo;s Weekly&rsquo; above quoted
from, it was here that he wrote &lsquo;Aylwin.&rsquo;&nbsp; I
have already alluded to his record of this most interesting
event:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have just read,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;with the greatest interest the article in your number of
Sept. 18, 1903, called &lsquo;How Authors Work Best.&rsquo;&nbsp;
But the following sentence in it set me reflecting:
&lsquo;Flaubert took ten years to write and repolish
&ldquo;Madame Bovary,&rdquo; Watts-Dunton twenty years to write,
recast, and conclude &ldquo;Aylwin.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; The
statement about &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; has often been made, and in
<a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>these days
of hasty production it may well be taken by the author as a
compliment; but it is as entirely apocryphal as that about
Scott&rsquo;s brother having written the Waverley Novels, and as
that about Bramwell Bront&euml; having written &lsquo;Wuthering
Heights.&rsquo;&nbsp; As to &lsquo;Aylwin,&rsquo; I happen to be
in a peculiarly authoritative position to speak upon the genesis
of this very popular book.&nbsp; If any one were to peruse the
original manuscript of the story he would find it in four
different handwritings&mdash;my late father&rsquo;s, and two of
my brothers&rsquo;, but principally in mine.</p>
<p>Yet I can aver that it was not written by us, and also that
its composition did not take twenty years to achieve.&nbsp; It
was dictated to us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Gordon Hake is mainly known as the &lsquo;parable
poet,&rsquo; but as a fact he was a physician of extraordinary
talent, who had practised first at Bury St. Edmunds and
afterwards at Spring Gardens, until he partly retired to be
private physician to the late Lady Ripon.&nbsp; After her death
he left practice altogether in order to devote himself to
literature, for which he had very great equipments.&nbsp; As
&lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; touched upon certain subtle nervous phases
it must have been a great advantage to the author to dictate
these portions of the story to so skilled and experienced a
friend.&nbsp; The rare kind of cerebral exaltation into which
Henry Aylwin passed after his appalling experience in the Cove,
in which the entire nervous system was disturbed, was not what is
known as brain fever.&nbsp; The record of it in
&lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; is, I understand, a literal account of a
rare and wonderful case brought under the professional notice of
Dr. Hake.</p>
<p>As physician to Rossetti, a few years after the death of his
beloved wife, Dr. Hake&rsquo;s services must have been priceless
to the poet-painter; for, as is only too well <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>known,
Rossetti&rsquo;s grief for the death of his wife had for some
time a devastating effect upon his mind.&nbsp; It was one of the
causes of that terrible insomnia to relieve himself from which he
resorted to chloral, though later on the attacks upon him by
certain foes intensified the distressing ailment.&nbsp; The
insomnia produced fits of melancholia, an ailment, according to
the skilled opinion of Dr. Hake, more difficult than all others
to deal with; for when the nervous system has sunk to a certain
state of depression, the mind roams over the universe, as it
were, in quest of imaginary causes for the depression.&nbsp; This
accounts for the &lsquo;cock and bull&rsquo; stories that were
somewhat rife immediately after Rossetti&rsquo;s death about his
having expressed remorse on account of his ill-treatment of his
wife.&nbsp; No one of his intimates took the least notice of
these wild and whirling words.&nbsp; For he would express remorse
on account of the most fantastic things when the fits of
melancholia were upon him; and when these fits were past he would
smile at the foolish things he had said.&nbsp; I get this
knowledge from a very high authority, Dr. Hake&rsquo;s
son&mdash;Mr. Thomas St. E. Hake, before mentioned&mdash;who knew
Rossetti intimately from 1871 until his death, having lived under
the same roof with him at Cheyne Walk, Bognor and
Kelmscott.&nbsp; After Rossetti&rsquo;s most serious attack of
melancholia, his relations and friends persuaded him to stay with
Dr. Hake at Roehampton, and it was there that the terrible crisis
of his illness was passed.</p>
<p>It is interesting to know that in the original form of
&lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; the important part taken in the development
of the story by D&rsquo;Arcy was taken by Dr. Hake, under the
name of Gordon, and that afterwards, when all sorts of ungenerous
things were written about Rossetti, D&rsquo;Arcy was substituted
for Gordon in order to give the author <a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>an opportunity of bringing out and
showing the world the absolute nobility and charm of
Rossetti&rsquo;s character.</p>

<p>Among the many varieties of life which Mr. Watts-Dunton saw at
this time was life in the slums; and this was long before the
once fashionable pastime of &lsquo;slumming&rsquo; was
invented.&nbsp; The following lines in Dr. Hake&rsquo;s
&lsquo;New Day&rsquo; allude to the deep interest that Mr.
Watts-Dunton has always shown in the poor&mdash;shown years
before the writers who now deal with the slums had written a
line.&nbsp; Artistically, they are not fair specimens of Dr.
Gordon Hake&rsquo;s verses, but nevertheless it is interesting to
quote them here:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Know you a widow&rsquo;s home? an orphanage?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A place of shelter for the
crippled poor?<br />
Did ever limbless men your care engage<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whom you assisted of your larger store?<br />
Know you the young who are to early die&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At their frail form sinks not your heart within?<br
/>
Know you the old who paralytic lie<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While you the freshness of your life begin?<br />
Know you the great pain-bearers who long carry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The bullet in the breast that does not kill?<br />
And those who in the house of madness tarry,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond the blest relief of human skill?<br />
These have you visited, all these assisted,<br />
In the high ranks of charity enlisted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That Mr. Watts-Dunton has retained his interest in the poor is
shown by the sonnet, &lsquo;Father Christmas in Famine
Street,&rsquo; which was originally printed as &lsquo;an
appeal&rsquo; on Christmas Eve in the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>When Father Christmas went down Famine Street<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; He saw two little sisters: one was trying<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To lift the other, pallid, wasted, dying,<br />
Within an arch, beyond the slush and sleet.</p>
<p><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>From
out the glazing eyes a glimmer sweet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Leapt, as in answer to the other&rsquo;s sighing,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; While came a murmur, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee
keep on crying&mdash;<br />
I wants to die: you&rsquo;ll get my share to eat.&rsquo;<br />
Her knell was tolled by joy-bells of the city<br />
Hymning the birth of Jesus, Lord of Pity,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lover of children, Shepherd of Compassion.<br />
Said Father Christmas, while his eyes grew dim,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;They do His bidding&mdash;if in thrifty
fashion:<br />
They let the little children go to Him.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With this sonnet should be placed that entitled,
&lsquo;Dickens Returns on Christmas Day&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>A ragged girl in Drury Lane was heard to exclaim:
&lsquo;Dickens dead?&nbsp; Then will Father Christmas die
too?&rsquo;&mdash;June 9, 1870.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dickens is dead!&rsquo;&nbsp; Beneath that grievous
cry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; London seemed shivering in the summer heat;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Strangers took up the tale like friends that
meet:<br />
&lsquo;Dickens is dead!&rsquo; said they, and hurried by;<br />
Street children stopped their games&mdash;they knew not why,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; But some new night seemed darkening down the
street.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A girl in rags, staying her wayworn feet,<br />
Cried, &lsquo;Dickens dead?&nbsp; Will Father Christmas
die?&rsquo;</p>
<p>City he loved, take courage on thy way!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He loves thee still, in all thy joys and fears.<br
/>
Though he whose smile made bright thine eyes of grey&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though he whose voice, uttering thy burthened
years,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Made laughters bubble through thy sea of
tears&mdash;<br />
Is gone, Dickens returns on Christmas Day!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let me say here, parenthetically, that &lsquo;The Pines&rsquo;
is so far out of date that for twenty-five years it has been
famous for its sympathy with the Christmas sentiment which now
seems to be fading, as this sonnet shows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>THE CHRISTMAS
TREE AT &lsquo;THE PINES.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Life still hath one romance that naught can bury&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not Time himself, who coffins Life&rsquo;s
romances&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For still will Christmas gild the year&rsquo;s
mischances,<br />
If Childhood comes, as here, to make him merry&mdash;<br />
To kiss with lips more ruddy than the cherry&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To smile with eyes outshining by their glances<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Christmas tree&mdash;to dance with fairy
dances<br />
And crown his hoary brow with leaf and berry.</p>
<p>And as to us, dear friend, the carols sung<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are fresh as ever.&nbsp; Bright is yonder bough<br
/>
Of mistletoe as that which shone and swung<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When you and I and Friendship made a vow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That Childhood&rsquo;s Christmas still should seal
each brow&mdash;<br />
Friendship&rsquo;s, and yours, and mine&mdash;and keep us
young.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I may also quote from &lsquo;Prophetic Pictures at
Venice&rsquo; this romantic description of the Rosicrucian
Christmas:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>(The morning light falls on the Rosicrucian
panel-picture called &lsquo;The Rosy Scar,&rsquo; depicting
Christian galley-slaves on board an Algerine galley, watching, on
Christmas Eve, for the promised appearance of Rosenkreutz, as a
&lsquo;rosy phantom.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Lover reads aloud the
descriptive verses on the frame.)</p>
<p>While Night&rsquo;s dark horses waited for the wind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He stood&mdash;he shone&mdash;where Sunset&rsquo;s
fiery glaives<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Flickered behind the clouds; then, o&rsquo;er the
waves,<br />
He came to them, Faith&rsquo;s remnant sorrow-thinned.<br />
The Paynim sailors clustering, tawny-skinned,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cried, &lsquo;Who is he that comes to Christian
slaves?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor water-sprite nor jinni of sunset caves,<br />
The rosy phantom stands nor winged nor finned.&rsquo;</p>
<p>All night he stood till shone the Christmas star;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Slowly the Rosy Cross, streak after streak,<br />
Flushed the grey sky&mdash;flushed sea and sail and spar,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Flushed, blessing every slave&rsquo;s woe-wasted
cheek.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then did great Rosenkreutz, the Dew-King speak:<br
/>
&lsquo;Sufferers, take heart!&nbsp; Christ lends the Rosy
Scar.&rsquo;</p>

95</span>Chapter IX<br />
GEORGE BORROW</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was not until 1872 that Mr.
Watts-Dunton was introduced to Borrow by Dr. Gordon Hake,
Borrow&rsquo;s most intimate friend.</p>
<p>The way in which this meeting came about has been familiar to
the readers of an autobiographical romance (not even yet
published!) wherein Borrow appears under the name of Dereham, and
Hake under the name of Gordon.&nbsp; But as some of these
passages in a modified form have appeared in print in an
introduction by Mr. Watts-Dunton to the edition of Borrow&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Lavengro,&rsquo; published by Messrs. Ward, Lock &amp;
Co., in 1893, there will be nothing incongruous in my quoting
them here:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Great as was the difference in age between
Gordon and me, there soon grew up an intimacy between us.&nbsp;
It has been my experience to learn that an enormous deal of
nonsense has been written about difference of age between friends
of either sex.&nbsp; At that time I do not think I had one
intimate friend of my own age except Rosamond, while I was on
terms of something like intimacy with two or three distinguished
men, each one of whom was certainly old enough to be my
father.&nbsp; Basevi was one of these: so was Lineham.&nbsp; I
daresay it was owing to some idiosyncrasy of mine, but the
intimacy between me and the young fellows with whom I was brought
into <a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>contact was mainly confined to matters connected with
field-sports.&nbsp; I found it far easier to be brought into
relations of close intimacy with women of my own age than with
men.&nbsp; But as Basevi told me that it was the same with
himself, I suppose that this was not an eccentricity after
all.&nbsp; When Gordon and I were together it never occurred to
me that there was any difference in our ages at all, and he told
me that it was the same with himself.</p>
<p>One day when I was sitting with him in his delightful house
near Roehampton, whose windows at the back looked over Richmond
Park, and in front over the wildest part of Wimbledon Common, one
of his sons came in and said that he had seen Dereham striding
across the common, evidently bound for the house.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dereham!&rsquo; I said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is there a man in
the world I should so like to see as Dereham?&rsquo;</p>
<p>And then I told Gordon how I had seen him years before
swimming in the sea off Yarmouth, but had never spoken to
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why do you want so much to see him?&rsquo; asked
Gordon.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, among other things I want to see if he is a true
Child of the Open Air.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Gordon laughed, perfectly understanding what I meant.&nbsp;
But it is necessary here to explain what that meaning was.</p>
<p>We both agreed that, with all the recent cultivation of the
picturesque by means of watercolour landscape, descriptive
novels, &lsquo;Cook&rsquo;s excursions,&rsquo; etc., the real
passion for Nature is as rare as ever it was&mdash;perhaps
rarer.&nbsp; It was, we believed, quite an affair of individual
temperament: it cannot be learned; it cannot be lost.&nbsp; That
no writer has ever tried to explain it shows how <a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>little it is
known.&nbsp; Often it has but little to do with poetry, little
with science.&nbsp; The poet, indeed, rarely has it at its very
highest; the man of science as rarely.&nbsp; I wish I could
define it.&nbsp; In human souls&mdash;in one, perhaps, as much as
in another&mdash;there is always that instinct for contact which
is a great factor of progress; there is always an irresistible
yearning to escape from isolation, to get as close as may be to
some other conscious thing.&nbsp; In most individuals this
yearning is simply for contact with other human souls; in some
few it is not.&nbsp; There are some in every country of whom it
is the blessing, not the bane that, owing to some exceptional
power, or to some exceptional infirmity, they can get closer to
&lsquo;Natura Benigna&rsquo; herself, closer to her whom we now
call &lsquo;Inanimate Nature,&rsquo; than to brother, sister,
wife, or friend.&nbsp; Darwin among English savants, and Emily
Bront&euml; among English poets, and Sinfi Lovell among English
gypsies, showed a good deal of the characteristics of the
&lsquo;Children of the Open Air.&rsquo;&nbsp; But in regard to
Darwin, besides the strength of his family ties, the pedantic
inquisitiveness, the methodizing pedantry of the man of science;
in Emily Bront&euml;, the sensitivity to human contact; and in
Sinn Lovell, subjection to the love passion&mdash;disturbed, and
indeed partially stifled, the native instinct with which they
were undoubtedly endowed.&nbsp; I was perfectly conscious that I
belonged to the third case of Nature-worshippers&mdash;that is, I
was one of those who, howsoever strongly drawn to Nature and to a
free and unconventional life, felt the strength of the love
passion to such a degree that it prevented my claiming to be a
genuine Child of the Open Air.</p>
<p>Between the true &lsquo;Children of the Open Air&rsquo; and
their fellows there are barriers of idiosyncrasy, barriers of
convention, or other barriers quite indefinable, which <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>they find
most difficult to overpass, and, even when they succeed in
overpassing them, the attempt is not found to be worth the
making.&nbsp; For, what this kind of Nature-worshipper finds in
intercourse with his fellow-men is, not the unegoistic frankness
of Nature, his first love, inviting him to touch her close, soul
to soul&mdash;but another ego enisled like his
own&mdash;sensitive, shrinking, like his own&mdash;a soul which,
love him as it may, is, nevertheless, and for all its love, the
central ego of the universe to itself, the very Alcyone round
whom all other Nature-worshippers revolve like the rest of the
human constellations.&nbsp; But between these and Nature there is
no such barrier, and upon Nature they lavish their love, &lsquo;a
most equal love&rsquo; that varies no more with her change of
mood than does the love of a man for a beautiful woman, whether
she smiles, or weeps, or frowns.&nbsp; To them a Highland glen is
most beautiful; so is a green meadow; so is a mountain gorge or a
barren peak; so is a South American savannah.&nbsp; A balmy
summer is beautiful, but not more beautiful than a winter&rsquo;s
sleet beating about the face, and stinging every nerve into
delicious life.</p>
<p>To the &lsquo;Child of the Open Air&rsquo; life has but few
ills; poverty cannot touch him.&nbsp; Let the Stock Exchange rob
him of his bonds, and he will go and tend sheep in Sacramento
Valley, perfectly content to see a dozen faces in a year; so far
from being lonely, he has got the sky, the wind, the brown grass,
and the sheep.&nbsp; And as life goes on, love of Nature grows,
both as a cultus and a passion, and in time Nature seems
&lsquo;to know him and love him&rsquo; in her turn.</p>
<p>Dereham entered, and, suddenly coming upon me, there was no
retreating, and we were introduced.</p>
<p>He tried to be as civil as possible, but evidently he was much
annoyed.&nbsp; Yet there was something in the <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>very tone of
his voice that drew my heart to him, for to me he was the hero of
my boyhood still.&nbsp; My own shyness was being rapidly fingered
off by the rough handling of the world, but his retained all the
bloom of youth, and a terrible barrier it was; yet I attacked it
manfully.&nbsp; I knew from his books that Dereham had read but
little except in his own out-of-the-way directions; but then,
unfortunately, like all specialists, he considered that in these
his own special directions lay all the knowledge that was of any
value.&nbsp; Accordingly, what appeared to Dereham as the most
striking characteristic of the present age was its
ignorance.&nbsp; Unfortunately, too, I knew that for strangers to
talk of his own published books, or of gypsies, appeared to him
to be &lsquo;prying,&rsquo; though there I should have been quite
at home.&nbsp; I knew, however, from his books that in the
obscure English pamphlet literature of the last century,
recording the sayings and doings of eccentric people and strange
adventures, Dereham was very learned, and I too chanced to be far
from ignorant in that direction.&nbsp; I touched on Bamfylde
Moore Carew, but without effect.&nbsp; Dereham evidently
considered that every properly educated man was familiar with the
story of Bamfylde Moore Carew in its every detail.&nbsp; Then I
touched upon beer, the British bruiser, &lsquo;gentility
nonsense,&rsquo; and other &lsquo;nonsense&rsquo;; then upon
etymology&mdash;traced hoity-toityism to &lsquo;toit,&rsquo; a
roof&mdash;but only to have my shallow philology dismissed with a
withering smile.&nbsp; I tried other subjects in the same
direction, but with small success, till in a lucky moment I
bethought myself of Ambrose Gwinett.&nbsp; There is a very scarce
eighteenth century pamphlet narrating the story of Ambrose
Gwinett, the man who, after having been hanged and gibbeted for
murdering a traveller with whom he had shared a double-bedded
room at a seaside <a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>inn, revived in the night, escaped from the
gibbet-irons, went to sea as a common sailor, and afterwards met
on a British man-of-war the very man he had been hanged for
murdering.&nbsp; The truth was that Gwinett&rsquo;s supposed
victim, having been seized on the night in question with a
violent bleeding at the nose, had risen and left the house for a
few minutes&rsquo; walk in the sea-breeze, when the press-gang
captured him and bore him off to sea, where he had been in
service ever since.&nbsp; I introduced the subject of Ambrose
Gwinett, and Douglas Jerrold&rsquo;s play upon it, and at once
the ice between us thawed and we became friends.</p>
<p>We all went out of the house and looked over the common.&nbsp;
It chanced that at that very moment there were a few gypsies
encamped on the sunken road opposite to Gordon&rsquo;s
house.&nbsp; These same gypsies, by the by, form the subject of a
charming sketch by Herkomer which appeared in the
&lsquo;Graphic.&rsquo;&nbsp; Borrow took the trouble to assure us
that they were not of the better class of gypsies, the
gryengroes, but basket-makers.&nbsp; After passing this group we
went on the common.&nbsp; We did not at first talk much, but it
delighted me to see the mighty figure, strengthened by the years
rather than stricken by them, striding along between the whin
bushes or through the quags, now stooping over the water to pluck
the wild mint he loved, whose lilac-coloured blossoms perfumed
the air as he crushed them, now stopping to watch the water
wagtails by the ponds.</p>
<p>After the stroll we turned back and went, at Dereham&rsquo;s
suggestion, for a ramble through Richmond Park, calling on the
way at the &lsquo;Bald-Faced Stag&rsquo; in Kingston Vale, in
order that Dereham should introduce me to Jerry Abershaw&rsquo;s
sword, which was one of the special <a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>glories of that once famous
hostelry.&nbsp; A divine summer day it was I remember&mdash;a day
whose heat would have been oppressive had it not been tempered
every now and then by a playful silvery shower falling from an
occasional wandering cloud, whose slate-coloured body thinned at
the edges to a fringe of lace brighter than any silver.</p>
<p>These showers, however, seemed, as Dereham remarked, merely to
give a rich colour to the sunshine, and to make the wild flowers
in the meadows on the left breathe more freely.&nbsp; In a word,
it was one of those uncertain summer days whose peculiarly
English charm was Dereham&rsquo;s special delight.&nbsp; He liked
rain, but he liked it falling on the green umbrella (enormous,
shaggy, like a gypsy-tent after a summer storm) he generally
carried.&nbsp; As we entered the Robin Hood Gate we were
confronted by a sudden weird yellow radiance, magical and
mysterious, which showed clearly enough that in the sky behind us
there was gleaming over the fields and over Wimbledon Common a
rainbow of exceptional brilliance, while the raindrops sparkling
on the ferns seemed answering every hue in the magic arch far
away.&nbsp; Dereham told us some interesting stories of Romany
superstition in connection with the rainbow&mdash;how, by making
a &lsquo;trus&rsquo;hul&rsquo; (cross) of two sticks, the Romany
chi who &lsquo;pens the dukkerin can wipe the rainbow out of the
sky,&rsquo; etc.&nbsp; Whereupon Gordon, quite as original a man
as Dereham, and a humourist of a rarer temper, launched out into
a strain of wit and whim, which it is not my business here to
record, upon the subject of the &lsquo;Spirit of the
Rainbow&rsquo; which I, as a child, went out to find.</p>
<p>Dereham loved Richmond Park, and he seemed to know every
tree.&nbsp; I found also that he was extremely learned in deer,
and seemed familiar with every dappled <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>coat which,
washed and burnished by the showers, seemed to shine in the sun
like metal.&nbsp; Of course, I observed him closely, and I began
to wonder whether I had encountered, in the silvery-haired giant
striding by my side, with a vast umbrella under his arm, a true
&lsquo;Child of the Open Air.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did a true Child of the Open Air ever carry a gigantic
green umbrella that would have satisfied Sarah Gamp
herself?&rsquo; I murmured to Gordon, while Dereham lingered
under a tree and, looking round the Park, said in a dreamy way,
&lsquo;Old England!&nbsp; Old England!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was the umbrella, green, manifold and bulging, under
Dereham&rsquo;s arm, that made me ask Gordon, as Dereham walked
along beneath the trees, &lsquo;Is he a genuine Child of the Open
Air?&rsquo;&nbsp; And then, calling to mind the books he had
written, I said: &lsquo;He went into the Dingle, and lived
alone&mdash;went there, not as an experiment in self-education,
as Thoreau went and lived by Walden Pond.&nbsp; He could enjoy
living alone, for the &lsquo;horrors&rsquo; to which he was
occasionally subject did not spring from solitary living.&nbsp;
He was never disturbed by passion as was the Nature-worshipper
who once played such selfish tricks with Sinfi Lovell, and as
Emily Bront&euml; would certainly have been had she been placed
in such circumstances as Charlotte Bront&euml; placed
Shirley.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But the most damning thing of all,&rsquo; said Gordon,
&lsquo;is that umbrella, gigantic and green: a painful thought
that has often occurred to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Passion has certainly never disturbed his
nature-worship,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;So devoid of passion
is he that to depict a tragic situation is quite beyond his
powers.&nbsp; Picturesque he always is, powerful never.&nbsp; No
one reading an account of the privations of the hero of this
story finds himself able to realize from Dereham&rsquo;s
description <a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>the misery of a young man tenderly reared, and with all
the pride of an East Anglian gentleman, living on bread and water
in a garret, with starvation staring him in the face.&nbsp; It is
not passion,&rsquo; I said to Gordon, &lsquo;that prevents
Dereham from enjoying the peace of the Nature-worshipper.&nbsp;
It is Ambition!&nbsp; His books show that he could never cleanse
his stuffed bosom of the perilous stuff of ambition.&nbsp; To
become renowned, judging from many a peroration in his books, was
as great an incentive to Dereham to learn languages as to
Alexander Smith&rsquo;s poet-hero it was an incentive to write
poetry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ambition and the green gamp,&rsquo; said Gordon.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But look, the rainbow is fading from the sky without the
intervention of gypsy sorceries; and see how the ferns are
changing colour with the change in the light.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But I soon found that if Dereham was not a perfect Child of
the Open Air, he was something better: a man of that deep
sympathy with human kind which the &lsquo;Child of the Open
Air&rsquo; must needs lack.</p>
<p>Knowing Dereham&rsquo;s extraordinary shyness and his great
dislike of meeting strangers, Gordon, while Dereham was trying to
get as close to the deer as they would allow, expressed to me his
surprise at the terms of cordial friendship that sprang up
between us during that walk.&nbsp; But I was not surprised: there
were several reasons why Dereham should at once take to
me&mdash;reasons that had nothing whatever to do with any
inherent attractiveness of my own.</p>
<p>By recalling what occurred I can throw a more brilliant light
upon Dereham&rsquo;s character than by any kind of analytical
disquisition.</p>
<p>Two herons rose from the Ponds and flew away to where they
probably had their nests.&nbsp; By the expression <a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>on
Dereham&rsquo;s face as he stood and gazed at them, I knew that,
like myself, he had a passion for herons.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Were there many herons around Whittlesea Mere before it
was drained?&rsquo; I said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should think so,&rsquo; said he dreamily, &lsquo;and
every kind of water bird.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then, suddenly turning round upon me with a start, he said,
&lsquo;But how do you know that I knew Whittlesea
Mere?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You say in one of your books that you played among the
reeds of Whittlesea Mere when you were a child.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mention Whittlesea Mere in any of my
books,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;but you speak of a lake near
the old State prison at Norman Cross, and that was Whittlesea
Mere.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you know Whittlesea Mere?&rsquo; said Dereham,
much interested.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know the place that was Whittlesea Mere before it was
drained,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;and I know the vipers around
Norman Cross, and I think I know the lane where you first met
that gypsy you have immortalized.&nbsp; He was a generation
before my time.&nbsp; Indeed, I never was thrown much across the
Petulengroes in the Eastern Counties, but I knew some of the
Hernes and the Lees and the Lovells.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I then told him what I knew about Romanies and vipers, and
also gave him Marcianus&rsquo;s story about the Moors being
invulnerable to the viper&rsquo;s bite, and about their putting
the true breed of a suspected child to the test by setting it to
grasp a viper&mdash;as he, Dereham, when a child, grasped one of
the vipers of Norman Cross.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The gypsies,&rsquo; said Dereham, &lsquo;always
believed me <a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>to be a Romany.&nbsp; But surely you are not a Romany
Rye?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;but I am a student of
folk-lore; and besides, as it has been my fortune to see every
kind of life in England, high and low, I could not entirely
neglect the Romanies, could I?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should think not,&rsquo; said Dereham
indignantly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I hope you don&rsquo;t know the literary class
among the rest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gordon is my only link to that dark world,&rsquo; I
said, &lsquo;and even you don&rsquo;t object to Gordon.&nbsp; I
am purer than he, purer than you, from the taint of
printers&rsquo; ink.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He laughed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The very question I have been asking myself ever since
I was a child in short frocks,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;and have
never yet found an answer.&nbsp; But Gordon agrees with me that
no well-bred soul should embarrass itself with any such
troublesome query.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This gave a chance to Gordon, who in such local reminiscences
as these had been able to take no part.&nbsp; The humorous
mystery of Man&rsquo;s personality had often been a subject of
joke between him and me in many a ramble in the Park and
elsewhere.&nbsp; At once he threw himself into a strain of
whimsical philosophy which partly amused and partly vexed
Dereham, who stood waiting to return to the subject of the
gypsies and East Anglia.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are an Englishman?&rsquo; said Dereham.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not only an Englishman, but an East Englishman,&rsquo;
I said, using a phrase of his own in one of his
books&mdash;&lsquo;if not a thorough East Anglian, an East
Midlander; who, you will admit, is nearly as good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nearly,&rsquo; said Dereham.</p>
<p><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>And
when I went on to tell him that I once used to drive a genuine
&lsquo;Shales mare,&rsquo; a descendant of that same famous
Norfolk trotter who could trot fabulous miles an hour, to whom he
with the Norfolk farmers raised his hat in reverence at the
Norwich horse fair; and when I promised to show him a portrait of
this same East Anglian mare with myself behind her in a
dogcart&mdash;an East Anglian dogcart; when I praised the
stinging saltness of the sea water off Yarmouth, Lowestoft, and
Cromer, the quality which makes it the best, the most buoyant,
the most delightful of all sea-water to swim in; when I told him
that the only English river in which you could see reflected the
rainbow he loved was &lsquo;the glassy Ouse&rsquo; of East
Anglia, and the only place in England where you could see it
reflected in the wet sand was the Norfolk coast; and when I told
him a good many things showing that I was in very truth, not only
an Englishman, but an East Englishman, my conquest of Dereham was
complete, and from that moment we became friends.</p>
<p>Gordon meanwhile stood listening to the rooks in the
distance.&nbsp; He turned and asked Dereham whether he had never
noticed a similarity between the kind of muffled rattling roar
made by the sea waves upon a distant pebbly beach and the sound
of a large rookery in the distance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is on sand alone,&rsquo; said Dereham, &lsquo;that
the sea strikes its true music&mdash;Norfolk sand; a rattle is
not music.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The best of the sea&rsquo;s lutes,&rsquo; I said,
&lsquo;is made by the sands of Cromer.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>These famous walks with Borrow (or Dereham, as he is called in
the above quotation) in Richmond Park and <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>the
neighbourhood, have been thus described by the
&lsquo;Gordon&rsquo; of the story in one of the sonnets in
&lsquo;The New Day&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>And he the walking lord of gipsy lore!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How often &rsquo;mid the deer that grazed the
park,<br />
Or in the fields and heath and windy moor,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Made musical with many a soaring lark,<br />
Have we not held brisk commune with him there,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While Lavengro, there towering by your side,<br />
With rose complexion and bright silvery hair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Would stop amid his swift and lounging stride<br />
To tell the legends of the fading race&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As at the summons of his piercing glance,<br />
Its story peopling his brown eyes and face,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While you called up that pendant of romance<br />
To Petulengro with his boxing glory,<br />
Your Amazonian Sinfi&rsquo;s noble story!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the &lsquo;Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica&rsquo; and in
Chambers&rsquo; &lsquo;Cyclop&aelig;dia of English
Literature,&rsquo; and scattered through scores of articles in
the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um,&rsquo; I find descriptions of Borrow
and allusions to him without number.&nbsp; They afford absolutely
the only portrait of that wonderful man that exists or is ever
likely to exist.&nbsp; But, of course, it is quite impossible for
me to fill my pages with Borrow when there are so many more
important figures waiting to be introduced.&nbsp; Still, I must
find room for the most brilliant little Borrow scene of all, for
it will flush these pages with a colour which I feel they
need.&nbsp; Mr. Watts-Dunton has been described as the most
picturesque of all living writers, whether in verse or in prose,
and it is not for me to gainsay that judgment; but never, I
think, is he so picturesque as when he is writing about
Borrow.</p>
<p>I am not quite clear as to where the following picture of <a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>gypsy life
is to be localized; but the scenery seems to be that of the part
of England where East Anglia and the Midlands join.&nbsp; It adds
interest to the incident to know that the beautiful gypsy girl
was the prototype of Rhona Boswell, and that Dereham is George
Borrow.&nbsp; This also is a chapter from the unpublished story
before mentioned, which was afterwards modified to be used in an
introductory essay to another of Borrow&rsquo;s books:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It was in the late summer, just before the
trees were clothed with what Dereham called &lsquo;gypsy
gold,&rsquo; and the bright green of the foliage showed scarcely
a touch of bronze&mdash;at that very moment, indeed, when the
spirits of all the wild flowers that have left the commons and
the hedgerows seem to come back for an hour and mingle their
half-forgotten perfumes with the new breath of calamint, ground
ivy, and pimpernel.&nbsp; Dereham gave me as hearty a greeting as
so shy a man could give.&nbsp; He told me that he was bound for a
certain camp of gryengroes, old friends of his in his wandering
days.&nbsp; In conversation I reminded him of our previous talk,
and I told him I chanced at that very moment to have in my pocket
a copy of the volume of Matthew Arnold in which appears
&lsquo;The Scholar-Gypsy.&rsquo;&nbsp; Dereham said he well
remembered my directing his attention to &lsquo;The
Scholar-Gypsy.&rsquo;&nbsp; After listening attentively to it,
Dereham declared that there was scarcely any latter-day poetry
worth reading, and also that, whatever the merits of Matthew
Arnold&rsquo;s poem might be, from any supposed artistic point of
view, it showed that Arnold had no conception of the Romany
temper, and that no gypsy could sympathise with it, or even
understand its motive in the least degree.&nbsp; I challenged
this, contending that howsoever Arnold&rsquo;s classic language
might soar above a gypsy&rsquo;s <a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>intelligence, the motive was so
clearly developed that the most illiterate person could grasp
it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish,&rsquo; said Dereham, &lsquo;you would come with
me to the camp and try the poem upon the first intelligent gypsy
woman we meet at the camp.&nbsp; As to gypsy men,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;they are too prosaic to furnish a fair test.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We agreed, and as we were walking across the country Dereham
became very communicative, and talked very volubly upon
gentility-nonsense, and many other pet subjects of his.&nbsp; I
already knew that he was no lover of the aristocracy of England,
or, as he called them, the &lsquo;trumpery great,&rsquo; although
in other regards he was such a John Bull.&nbsp; By this time we
had proceeded a good way on our little expedition.&nbsp; As we
were walking along, Dereham&rsquo;s eyes, which were as
longsighted as a gypsy&rsquo;s, perceived a white speck in a
twisted old hawthorn-bush some distance off.&nbsp; He stopped and
said: &lsquo;At first I thought that white speck in the bush was
a piece of paper, but it&rsquo;s a magpie,&rsquo;&mdash;next to
the water-wagtail, the gypsies&rsquo; most famous bird.&nbsp; On
going up to the bush we discovered a magpie couched among the
leaves.&nbsp; As it did not stir at our approach, I said to him:
&lsquo;It is wounded&mdash;or else dying&mdash;or is it a tamed
bird escaped from a cage?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Hawk!&rsquo; said
Dereham laconically, and turned up his face and gazed into the
sky.&nbsp; &lsquo;The magpie is waiting till the hawk has caught
his quarry and made his meal.&nbsp; I fancied he has himself been
&lsquo;chivvied&rsquo; by the hawk, as the gypsies would
say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And there, sure enough, beneath one of the silver clouds that
speckled the dazzling blue, a hawk&mdash;one of the kind which
takes its prey in the open rather than in the thick
woodlands&mdash;was wheeling up and up, trying its best to get
above a poor little lark in order to swoop at <a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>and devour
it.&nbsp; That the magpie had seen the hawk and had been a
witness of the opening of the tragedy of the lark was evident,
for in its dread of the common foe of all well-intentioned and
honest birds, it had forgotten its fear of all creatures except
the hawk.&nbsp; Man, in such a crisis as this, it looked upon as
a protecting friend.</p>
<p>As we were gazing at the bird a woman&rsquo;s voice at our
elbows said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s lucky to chivvy the hawk what chivvies a
magpie.&nbsp; I shall stop here till the hawk&rsquo;s flew
away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We turned round, and there stood a fine young gypsy woman,
carrying, gypsy fashion, a weakly child that in spite of its
sallow and wasted cheek proclaimed itself to be hers.&nbsp; By
her side stood a young gypsy girl.&nbsp; She was
beautiful&mdash;quite remarkably so&mdash;but her beauty was not
of the typical Romany kind.&nbsp; It was, as I afterwards
learned, more like the beauty of a Capri girl.</p>
<p>She was bareheaded&mdash;there was not even a gypsy
handkerchief on her head&mdash;her hair was not plaited, and was
not smooth and glossy like a gypsy girl&rsquo;s hair, but flowed
thick and heavy and rippling down the back of her neck and upon
her shoulders.&nbsp; In the tumbled tresses glittered certain
objects, which at first sight seemed to be jewels.&nbsp; They
were small dead dragonflies, of the crimson kind called
&lsquo;sylphs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To Dereham these gypsies were evidently well known.&nbsp; The
woman with the child was one of the Boswells; I dare not say what
was her connection, if any, with &lsquo;Boswell the
Great&rsquo;&mdash;I mean Sylvester Boswell, the grammarian and
&lsquo;well-known and popalated gypsy of Codling Gap,&rsquo; who,
on a memorable occasion, wrote so eloquently about the
superiority of the gypsy mode of life to all others, &lsquo;on
the accont of health, sweetness of air, and for enjoying the
pleasure of Nature&rsquo;s life.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>Dereham told me in a whisper that her name was
Perpinia, and that the other gypsy, the girl of the dragon-flies,
was the famous beauty of the neighbourhood&mdash;Rhona Boswell,
of whom many stories had reached him with regard to Percy Aylwin,
a relative of Rosamond&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>After greeting the two, Dereham looked at the weakling child
with the deepest interest, and said to the mother: &lsquo;This
chavo ought not to look like that&mdash;with such a mother as
you, Perpinia.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;And with such a daddy,
too,&rsquo; said she.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mike&rsquo;s stronger for a
man nor even I am for a woman&rsquo;&mdash;a glow of wifely pride
passing over her face; &lsquo;and as to good looks, it&rsquo;s
him as has got the good looks, not me.&nbsp; But none on us
can&rsquo;t make it out about the chavo.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s so weak
and sick he don&rsquo;t look as if he belonged to Boswell&rsquo;s
breed at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How many pipes of tobacco do you smoke in a day?&rsquo;
said I, looking at the great black cutty pipe protruding from
Perpinia&rsquo;s finely cut lips, and seeming strangely out of
place there.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t say,&rsquo; said she, laughing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;About as many as she can afford to buy,&rsquo;
interrupted &lsquo;the beauty of the Ouse,&rsquo; as Rhona
Boswell was called.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; Mike
don&rsquo;t like her a-smokin&rsquo;.&nbsp; He says it makes her
look like a old Londra Irish woman in Common Garding
Market.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must not smoke another pipe,&rsquo; said I to the
mother&mdash;&lsquo;not another pipe till the child leaves the
breast.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What?&rsquo; said Perpinia defiantly.&nbsp; &lsquo;As
if I could live without my pipe!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fancy Pep a-living without her baccy!&rsquo; laughed
Rhona.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your child can&rsquo;t live with it,&rsquo; said I to
Perpinia.&nbsp; &lsquo;That pipe of yours is full of a poison
called nicotine.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>&lsquo;Nick what?&rsquo; said Rhona, laughing.&nbsp;
&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a new kind of nick.&nbsp; Why, you smoke
yourself!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nicotine,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;And the first
part of Pep&rsquo;s body that the poison gets into is her breast,
and&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gets into my burk,&rsquo; <a name="citation112"></a><a
href="#footnote112" class="citation">[112]</a> said
Perpinia.&nbsp; &lsquo;Get along wi&rsquo; ye.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do it pison Pep&rsquo;s milk?&rsquo; said Rhona.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That ain&rsquo;t true,&rsquo; said
Perpinia&mdash;&lsquo;can&rsquo;t be true.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is true,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you
don&rsquo;t give up that pipe for a time, the child will die, or
else be a ricketty thing all his life.&nbsp; If you do give it
up, it will grow up to be as fine a gypsy as ever your husband
can be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Chavo agin pipe, Pep!&rsquo; said Rhona.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lend me your pipe, Perpinia,&rsquo; said Dereham, in
that hail-fellow-well-met tone of his, which he reserved for the
Romanies&mdash;a tone which no Romany could ever resist.&nbsp;
And he took it gently from the woman&rsquo;s lips.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t smoke any more till I come to the camp and see
the chavo again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He be&rsquo;s a good friend to the Romanies,&rsquo;
said Rhona, in an appeasing tone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rsquo; said the woman; &lsquo;but
he&rsquo;s no business to take my pipe out o&rsquo; my mouth for
all that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She soon began to smile again, however, and let Dereham retain
the pipe.&nbsp; Dereham and I then moved away towards the dusty
high-road leading to the camp, and were joined by Rhona.&nbsp;
Perpinia remained, keeping guard over the magpie that was to
bring luck to the sinking child.</p>
<p>It was determined now that Rhona was the very <a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>person to
be used as the test-critic of the Romany mind upon Arnold&rsquo;s
poem, for she was exceptionally intelligent.&nbsp; So instead of
going to the camp, the oddly assorted little party of three
struck across the ferns, gorse, and heather towards
&lsquo;Kingfisher brook,&rsquo; and when we reached it we sat
down on a fallen tree.</p>
<p>Nothing, as afterwards I came to know, delights a gypsy girl
so much, in whatever country she may be born, as to listen to a
story either told or read to her, and when I pulled my book from
my pocket the gypsy girl began to clap her hands.&nbsp; Her
anticipation of enjoyment sent over her face a warm glow.</p>
<p>Her complexion, though darker than an English girl&rsquo;s,
was rather lighter than an ordinary gypsy&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Her eyes
were of an indescribable hue; but an artist who has since then
painted her portrait for me, described it as a mingling of pansy
purple and dark tawny.&nbsp; The pupils were so large that, being
set in the somewhat almond-shaped and long-eyelashed lids of her
race, they were partly curtained both above and below, and this
had the peculiar effect of making the eyes seem always a little
contracted and just about to smile.&nbsp; The great size and deep
richness of the eyes made the straight little nose seem smaller
than it really was; they also lessened the apparent size of the
mouth, which, red as a rosebud, looked quite small until she
laughed, when the white teeth made quite a wide glitter.</p>
<p>Before three lines of the poem had been read she jumped up and
cried, &lsquo;Look at the Devil&rsquo;s needles!&nbsp;
They&rsquo;re come to sew my eyes up for killing their
brothers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And surely enough a gigantic dragon-fly, whose body-armour of
sky blue and jet black, and great lace-woven wings, shining like
a rainbow gauze, caught the sun as he <a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>swept dazzling by, did really seem
to be attracted either by the wings of his dead brothers or by
the lights shed from the girl&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I dussn&rsquo;t set here,&rsquo; said she.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Us Romanies call this &lsquo;Dragon-fly
Brook.&rsquo;&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s the king o&rsquo; the
dragon-flies: he lives here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As she rose she seemed to be surrounded by dragon-flies of
about a dozen different species of all sizes, some crimson, some
bronze, some green and gold, whirling and dancing round her as if
they meant to justify their Romany name and sew up the
girl&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Romanies call them the Devil&rsquo;s
needles,&rsquo; said Dereham; &lsquo;their business is to sew up
pretty girls&rsquo; eyes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In a second, however, they all vanished, and the girl after a
while sat down again to listen to the &lsquo;lil,&rsquo; as she
called the story.</p>

<blockquote><p>Glanville&rsquo;s prose story, upon which
Arnold&rsquo;s poem is based, was read first.&nbsp; In this Rhona
was much interested.&nbsp; But when I went on to read to her
Arnold&rsquo;s poem, though her eyes flashed now and then at the
lovely bits of description&mdash;for the country about Oxford is
quite remarkably like the country in which she was born&mdash;she
looked sadly bewildered, and then asked to have it all read
again.&nbsp; After a second reading she said in a meditative way:
&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t make out what the lil&rsquo;s all
about&mdash;seems all about nothink!&nbsp; Seems to me that the
pretty sights what makes a Romany fit to jump out o&rsquo; her
skin for joy makes this &rsquo;ere gorgio want to cry.&nbsp; What
a rum lot gorgios is surely!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And then she sprang up and ran off towards the camp with the
agility of a greyhound, turning round every few moments,
pirouetting and laughing aloud.</p>
<p><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s go to the camp!&rsquo; said
Dereham.&nbsp; &lsquo;That was all true about the
nicotine&mdash;was it not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Partly, I think,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;but not being a
medical man I must not be too emphatic.&nbsp; If it is true it
ought to be a criminal offence for any woman to smoke in excess
while she is suckling a child.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Say it ought to be a criminal offence for a woman to
smoke at all,&rsquo; growled Dereham.&nbsp; &lsquo;Fancy kissing
a woman&rsquo;s mouth that smelt of stale
tobacco&mdash;pheugh!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After giving these two delightful descriptions of Borrow and
his environment, I will now quote Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s
description of their last meeting:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The last time I ever saw Borrow was shortly
before he left London to live in the country.&nbsp; It was, I
remember well, on Waterloo Bridge, where I had stopped to gaze at
a sunset of singular and striking splendour, whose gorgeous
clouds and ruddy mists were reeling and boiling over the West
End.&nbsp; Borrow came up and stood leaning over the parapet,
entranced by the sight, as well he might be.&nbsp; Like most
people born in flat districts, he had a passion for
sunsets.&nbsp; Turner could not have painted that one, I think,
and certainly my pen could not describe it; for the London smoke
was flushed by the sinking sun and had lost its dunness, and,
reddening every moment as it rose above the roofs, steeples, and
towers, it went curling round the sinking sun in a rosy vapour,
leaving, however, just a segment of a golden rim, which gleamed
as dazzlingly as in the thinnest and clearest air&mdash;a
peculiar effect which struck Borrow deeply.&nbsp; I never saw
such a sunset before or since, not even on Waterloo Bridge; and
from its association with &lsquo;the last of Borrow&rsquo; I
shall never forget it.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>

class="pagenum">p. 116</span>A TALK ON WATERLOO BRIDGE<br />
<span class="smcap">The Last Sight of George Borrow</span></p>
<blockquote><p>We talked of &lsquo;Children of the Open
Air,&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who once on hill and valley lived aloof,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Loving the sun, the wind, the sweet reproof<br />
Of storms, and all that makes the fair earth fair,<br />
Till, on a day, across the mystic bar<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of moonrise, came the &lsquo;Children of the
Roof,&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who find no balm &rsquo;neath evening&rsquo;s
rosiest woof,<br />
Nor dews of peace beneath the Morning Star.</p>
<p>We looked o&rsquo;er London where men wither and choke,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Roofed in, poor souls, renouncing stars and
skies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And lore of woods and wild wind-prophecies&mdash;<br

Yea, every voice that to their fathers spoke:<br />
And sweet it seemed to die ere bricks and smoke<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Leave never a meadow outside Paradise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the noble music of this double valediction in poetry and
prose is sounding in our ears, my readers and I, &lsquo;with
wandering steps and slow,&rsquo; may also fitly take our
reluctant leave of George Borrow.</p>

117</span>Chapter X<br />
THE ACTED DRAMA</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was during the famous evenings
in Dr. Marston&rsquo;s house at Chalk Farm that Mr. Watts-Dunton
was for the first time brought into contact with the theatrical
world.&nbsp; I do not know that he was ever closely connected
with that world, but in the set in which he specially moved at
this time he seems to have been almost the only one who was a
regular playgoer and first-nighter, for Rossetti&rsquo;s
playgoing days were nearly over, and Mr. Swinburne never was a
playgoer.&nbsp; Mr. Watts-Dunton still takes, as may be seen in
his sonnet to Ellen Terry, which I shall quote, a deep interest
in the acted drama and in the acting profession, although of late
years he has not been much seen at the theatres.&nbsp; When,
after a while, he and Minto were at work on the
&lsquo;Examiner&rsquo; Mr. Watts-Dunton occasionally, although I
think rarely, wrote a theatrical critique for that paper.&nbsp;
The only one I have had an opportunity of reading is upon Miss
Neilson&mdash;not the Miss Julia Neilson who is so much admired
in our day; but the powerful, dark-eyed creole-looking beauty,
Lilian Adelaide Neilson, who, after being a mill-hand and a
barmaid, became a famous tragedian, and made a great impression
in Juliet, and in impassioned poetical parts of that kind.&nbsp;
The play in which she appeared on that occasion was a play by Tom
Taylor, called &lsquo;Anne <a name="page118"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 118</span>Boleyn,&rsquo; in which Miss Neilson
took the part of the heroine.&nbsp; It was given at the Haymarket
in February 1876.&nbsp; I do not remember reading any criticism
in which so much admirable writing&mdash;acute, brilliant, and
learned&mdash;was thrown away upon so mediocre a play.&nbsp; Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s remarks upon Miss Neilson&rsquo;s acting
were, however, not thrown away, for the subject seems to have
been fully worthy of them; and I, who love the acted drama
myself, regret that the actress&rsquo;s early death in 1880,
robbed me of the pleasure of seeing her.&nbsp; She was one of the
actresses whom Mr. Watts-Dunton used to meet on Sunday evenings
at Marston&rsquo;s, and I have heard him say that her genius was
as apparent in her conversation as in her acting.&nbsp; Miss
Corkran has recently sketched one of these meetings, and has
given us a graphic picture of Mr. Watts-Dunton there, contrasting
his personal appearance with that of Mr. Swinburne.&nbsp; They
must indeed have been delightful gatherings to a lover of the
theatre, for there Miss Neilson, Miss Glyn, Miss Ada Cavendish,
and others were to be met&mdash;met in the company of Irving,
Sothern, Hermann Vezin, and many another famous actor.</p>
<p>That Mr. Watts-Dunton had a peculiar insight into histrionic
art was shown by what occurred on his very first appearance at
the Marston evenings, whither he was taken by his friend, Dr.
Gordon Hake, who used to tell the following story with great
humour; and Rossetti also used to repeat it with still greater
gusto.&nbsp; I am here again indebted to his son, Mr.
Hake&mdash;who was also a friend of Dr. Marston, Ada Cavendish,
and others&mdash;for interesting reminiscences of these Marston
evenings which have never been published.&nbsp; Mr. Watts-Dunton
at that time was, of course, quite unknown, except in a very
small circle of literary men and artists.&nbsp; <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>Three or
four dramatic critics, several poets, and two actresses, one of
whom was Ada Cavendish, were talking about Irving in &lsquo;The
Bells,&rsquo; which was a dramatization by a writer named Leopold
Lewis of the &lsquo;Juif Polonais&rsquo; of
Erckmann-Chatrian.&nbsp; They were all enthusiastically extolling
Irving&rsquo;s acting; and this is not surprising, as all will
say who have seen him in the part.&nbsp; But while some were
praising the play, others were running it down.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
I say,&rdquo; said one of the admirers, &ldquo;is that the motif
of &lsquo;The Bells,&rsquo; the use of the idea of a sort of
embodied conscience to tell the audience the story and bring
about the catastrophe, is the newest that has appeared in drama
or fiction&mdash;it is entirely original.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not entirely, I think,&rdquo; said a voice which, until
that evening, was new in the circle.&nbsp; They turned round to
listen to what the dark-eyed young stranger, tanned by the sun to
a kind of gypsy colour, who looked like William Black, quietly
smoking his cigarette, had to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not entirely new?&rdquo; said one.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who was
the originator, then, of the idea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you that,&rdquo; said the
interrupting voice, &ldquo;for it occurs in a very old Persian
story, and it was evidently old even then.&nbsp; But
Erckmann-Chatrian took it from a much later story-teller.&nbsp;
They adapted it from Chamisso.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the author of &lsquo;Peter
Schlemihl&rsquo;?&rdquo; said one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Mr. Watts-Dunton, &ldquo;but
Chamisso was a poet before he was a prose writer, and he wrote a
rhymed story in which the witness of a murder was the sunrise,
and at dawn the criminal was affected in the same way that
Matthias is affected by the sledge bells.&nbsp; The idea that the
sensorium, in an otherwise perfectly sane brain, can translate
sights and sound into accusations <a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>of a crime is, of course, perfectly
true, and in the play it is wonderfully given by
Irving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Dr. Marston, &ldquo;that is the best
account I have yet heard of the origin of &lsquo;The
Bells.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the voice of one of the disparagers of the play said:
&ldquo;There you are!&nbsp; The very core of
Erckmann-Chatrian&rsquo;s story and Lewis&rsquo;s play has been
stolen and spoilt from another writer.&nbsp; The acting, as I
say, is superb&mdash;the play is rot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I do not think so,&rdquo; said Mr.
Watts-Dunton.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think it a new and a striking
play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you give your reasons, sir?&rdquo; said Dr.
Marston, in that old-fashioned courtly way which was one of his
many charms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Mr. Watts-Dunton, &ldquo;if it
will be of any interest.&nbsp; You recollect Coleridge&rsquo;s
remarks upon expectation and surprise in drama.&nbsp; I think it
a striking play because I cannot recall any play in which the
entire source of interest is that of pure expectation
unadulterated by surprise.&nbsp; From the opening dialogue,
before ever the burgomaster appears, the audience knows that a
murder has been committed, and that the murderer must be the
burgomaster, and yet the audience is kept in breathless suspense
through pure expectation as to whether or not the crime will be
brought home to him, and if brought home to him, how.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the voice of one of the admirers of
the play, &ldquo;that is the best criticism of &lsquo;The
Bells&rsquo; I have yet heard.&rdquo;&nbsp; After this the
conversation turned upon Jefferson&rsquo;s acting of Rip Van
Winkle, and many admirable remarks fell from a dozen lips.&nbsp;
When there was a pause in these criticisms, Dr. Marston turned to
Mr. Watts-Dunton and said, &ldquo;Have you seen Jefferson in
&lsquo;Rip van Winkle,&rsquo; sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;many
times; and I hope to see it many more times.&nbsp; It is
wonderful.&nbsp; I think it lucky that I have been able to see
the great exemplar of what may be called the Garrick type of
actor, and the great exemplar of what may be called the Edmund
Kean type of actor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On being asked what he meant by this classification, Mr.
Watts-Dunton launched out into one of those wide-sweeping but
symmetrical monologues of criticism in which beginning, middle,
and end, were as perfectly marked as though the improvization had
been a well-considered essay&mdash;the subject being the style of
acting typified by Garrick and the style of acting typified by
Robson.&nbsp; As this same idea runs through Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s criticism of Got in &lsquo;Le Roi
s&rsquo;Amuse&rsquo; (which I shall quote later), there is no
need to dwell upon it here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As an instance,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;of
Jefferson&rsquo;s supreme power in this line of acting, one might
refer to Act II. of the play, where Rip mounts the Catskill
Mountains in the company of the goblins.&nbsp; Rip talks with the
goblins one after the other, and there seems to be a dramatic
dialogue going on.&nbsp; It is not till the curtain falls that
the audience realizes that every word spoken during that act came
from the lips of Rip, so entirely have Jefferson&rsquo;s facial
expression and intonation dramatized each goblin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Between Mr. Watts-Dunton and our great Shakespearean actress,
Ellen Terry, there has been an affectionate friendship running
over nearly a quarter of a century.&nbsp; This is not at all
surprising to one who knows Miss Terry&rsquo;s high artistic
taste and appreciation of poetry.&nbsp; Among the poems
expressing that friendship, none is more pleasing than the sonnet
that appeared in <a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>the &lsquo;Magazine of Art&rsquo; to which Mr. Bernard
Partridge contributed his superb drawing of Miss Terry in the
part of Queen Katherine.&nbsp; It is entitled, &lsquo;Queen
Katherine: on seeing Miss Ellen Terry as Katherine in King Henry
VIII&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Seeking a tongue for tongueless shadow-land,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Has Katherine&rsquo;s soul come back with power to
quell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A sister-soul incarnate, and compel<br />
Its bodily voice to speak by Grief&rsquo;s command?<br />
Or is it Katherine&rsquo;s self returns to stand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As erst she stood defying Wolsey&rsquo;s
spell&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Returns with those vile wrongs she fain would
tell<br />
Which memory bore to Eden&rsquo;s amaranth strand?</p>
<p>Or is it thou, dear friend&mdash;this Queen, whose face<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The salt of many tears hath scarred and
stung?&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Can it be thou, whose genius, ever young,<br />
Lighting the body with the spirit&rsquo;s grace,<br />
Is loved by England&mdash;loved by all the race<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Round all the world enlinked by Shakespeare&rsquo;s
tongue!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With one exception I do not find any dramatic criticisms by
Mr. Watts-Dunton in the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Indeed, I should not expect to find him trenching upon the domain
of the greatest dramatic critic of our time, Mr. Joseph
Knight.&nbsp; No one speaks with greater admiration of Mr. Knight
than his friend of thirty years&rsquo; standing, Mr. Watts-Dunton
himself; and when an essay on &lsquo;King John&rsquo; was
required for the series of Shakespeare essays to accompany Mr.
Edwin Abbey&rsquo;s famous illustrations in &lsquo;Harper&rsquo;s
Magazine,&rsquo; it was Mr. Knight whom Mr. Watts-Dunton invited
to discuss this important play.&nbsp; The exception I allude to
is the criticism of Victor Hugo&rsquo;s &lsquo;Le Roi
s&rsquo;Amuse,&rsquo; which appeared in the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; of December 2, 1882.</p>
<p>The way in which it came about that Mr. Watts-Dunton <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>undertook
for the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; so important a piece of
dramatic criticism is interesting.&nbsp; In 1882 M. Vacquerie,
the editor of &lsquo;Le Rappel,&rsquo; a relative of
Hugo&rsquo;s, and a great friend of Mr. Swinburne and Mr.
Watts-Dunton, together with other important members of the Hugo
cenacle, determined to get up a representation of &lsquo;Le Roi
s&rsquo;Amuse&rsquo; on the jubilee of its first representation,
since when it had never been acted.&nbsp; Vacquerie sent two
fauteuils, one for Mr. Swinburne and one for Mr. Watts-Dunton;
and the two poets were present at that memorable
representation.&nbsp; Long before the appointed day there was on
the Continent, from Paris to St. Petersburg, an unprecedented
demand for seats; for it was felt that this was the most
interesting dramatic event that had occurred for fifty years.</p>
<p>Consequently the editor of the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo;
for once invited his chief literary contributor to fill the post
which the dramatic editor of the paper, Mr. Joseph Knight,
generously yielded to him for the occasion, and the following
article appeared:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Paris, November
23, 1882.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I felt that the revival, at the Theatre
Fran&ccedil;ais, of &lsquo;Le Roi s&rsquo;Amuse,&rsquo; on the
fiftieth anniversary of its original production, must be one of
the most interesting literary events of our time, and so I found
it to be.&nbsp; Victor Hugo was there, sitting with his arms
folded across his breast, calm but happy, in a stage box.&nbsp;
He expressed himself satisfied and even delighted with the
acting.&nbsp; The poet&rsquo;s appearance was fuller of vitality
and more Olympian than ever.&nbsp; Between the acts he left the
theatre and walked about in the square, leaning on the arm of his
illustrious poet friend and family connection, Auguste <a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>Vacquerie,
to whose kindness I was indebted for a seat in the fauteuils
d&rsquo;orchestre, which otherwise I should have found to be
quite unattainable, so unprecedented was the demand for
places.&nbsp; It is said that a thousand francs were given for a
seat.&nbsp; Never before was seen, even in a French theatre, an
audience so brilliant and so illustrious.&nbsp; I did not,
however, see any English face I knew save that of Mr. Swinburne,
who at the end of the third act might have been seen talking to
Hugo in his box.&nbsp; Among the most appreciative and
enthusiastic of those who assisted at the representation was the
French poet, who perhaps in the nineteenth century stands next to
Hugo for intellectual massiveness, M. Leconte de Lisle.&nbsp; And
I should say that every French poet and indeed every man of
eminence was there.</p>
<p>Considering the extraordinary nature of the piece, the cast
was perhaps as satisfactory as could have been hoped for.&nbsp;
Fond as is M. Hugo of spectacular effects, and even of coups de
th&eacute;&acirc;tre, no other dramatist gives so little
attention as he to the idiosyncrasies of actors.&nbsp; It is easy
to imagine that Shakespeare in writing his lines was not always
unmindful of an actor like Burbage.&nbsp; But in depicting
Triboulet, Hugo must have thought as little about the
specialities of Ligier, who took the part on the first night in
1832, as of the future Got, who was to take it on the second
night in 1882.&nbsp; And the same may be said of Blanche in
relation to the two actresses who successively took that
part.&nbsp; This is, I think, exactly the way in which a
dramatist should work.&nbsp; The contrary method is not more
ruinous to drama as a literary form than to the actor&rsquo;s
art.&nbsp; To write up to an actor&rsquo;s style destroys all
true character-drawing; also it ends by writing up to the
actor&rsquo;s mere manner, who from that moment is, as an artist,
doomed.&nbsp; On the whole, the <a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>performance wanted more glow and
animal spirits.&nbsp; The Fran&ccedil;ois I of M. Mounet-Sully
was full of verve, but this actor&rsquo;s voice is so exceedingly
rich and emotional that the king seemed more poetic, and hence
more sympathetic to the audience, than was consistent with a
character who in a sense is held up as the villain of the
piece.&nbsp; The true villain, here, however, as in
&lsquo;Torquemada,&rsquo; &lsquo;Notre Dame de Paris,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Les Mis&eacute;rables,&rsquo; and, indeed, in all
Hugo&rsquo;s characteristic works, is not an individual at all,
but Circumstance.&nbsp; Circumstance placed Francis, a young and
pleasure-loving king, over a licentious court.&nbsp; Circumstance
gave him a court jester with a temper which, to say the least of
it, was peculiar for such times as those.&nbsp; Circumstance,
acting through the agency of certain dissolute courtiers, thrust
into the king&rsquo;s very bedroom the girl whom he loved and who
belonged to a class from whom he had been taught to expect
subservience of every kind.&nbsp; The tragic mischief of the rape
follows almost as a necessary consequence.&nbsp; Add to this the
fact that Circumstance contrives that the girl Maguelonne,
instead of aiding her more conscientious brother in killing the
disguised king at the bidding of &lsquo;the client who
pays,&rsquo; falls unexpectedly in love with him; while
Circumstance also contrives that Blanche shall be there ready at
the very spot at the very moment where and when she is
imperatively wanted as a substituted victim;&mdash;and you get
the entire motif of &lsquo;Le Roi s&rsquo;Amuse&rsquo;&mdash;man
enmeshed in a web of circumstance, the motif of &lsquo;Notre Dame
de Paris,&rsquo; the motif of &lsquo;Torquemada,&rsquo; and, in a
certain deep sense, perhaps the proper motif in romantic
drama.&nbsp; For when the vis matrix of classic drama, the
supernatural interference of conscious Destiny, was no longer
available to the artist, something akin to it&mdash;something
nobler and more powerful than <a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>the stage villain&mdash;was found to
be necessary to save tragedy from sinking into melodrama.&nbsp;
And this explains so many of the complexities of Shakespeare.</p>
<p>In the dramas of Victor Hugo, however, the romantic temper has
advanced quite as far as it ought to advance not only in the use
of Circumstance as the final cause of the tragic mischief, but in
the use of the grotesque in alliance with the terrible.&nbsp; The
greatest masters of the terrible-grotesque till we get to the
German romanticists were the English dramatists of the sixteenth
and the early portion of the seventeenth century, and of course
by far the greatest among these was Shakespeare.&nbsp; For the
production of the effect in question there is nothing comparable
to the scenes in &lsquo;Lear&rsquo; between the king and the
fool&mdash;scenes which seem very early in his life to have
struck Hugo more than anything else in literature.&nbsp; Outside
the Elizabethan dramatists, however, there can be no doubt that
(leaving out of the discussion the great German masters in this
line) Hugo is the greatest worker in the terrible-grotesque that
has appeared since Burns.&nbsp; I need only point to Quasimodo
and Triboulet and compare them not merely with such attempts in
this line as those of writers like Beddoes, but even with the
magnificent work of Mr. Browning, who though far more subtle than
Hugo is without his sublimity and amazing power over
chiaroscuro.&nbsp; Now, the most remarkable feature of the
revival of &lsquo;Le Roi s&rsquo;Amuse,&rsquo; and that which
made me above all other reasons desirous to see it, was that the
character of Triboulet was to be rendered by an actor of rare and
splendid genius, but who, educated in the genteel comedy of
modern France and also in the social subtleties of
Moli&egrave;re, seemed the last man in Paris to give that
peculiar expression of the romantic temper which I have called
the terrible-grotesque.</p>
<p><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>That
M. Got&rsquo;s success in a part so absolutely unsuited to him
should have been as great as it was is, in my judgment, the
crowning success of his life.&nbsp; It is as though Thackeray,
after completing &lsquo;Philip,&rsquo; had set himself to write a
romance in the style of &lsquo;Notre Dame de Paris,&rsquo; and
succeeded in the attempt.&nbsp; Yet the success of M. Got was
relative only, I think.&nbsp; The Triboulet was not the Triboulet
of the reader&rsquo;s own imaginings, but an admirable Triboulet
of the Com&eacute;die Fran&ccedil;aise.&nbsp; Perhaps, however,
the truth is that there is not an actor in Europe who could
adequately render such a character as Triboulet.</p>
<p>This is what I mean: all great actors are divisible into two
groups, which are by temperament and endowment the exact
opposites of each other.&nbsp; There are those who, like Garrick,
producing their effects by means of a self-dominance and a
conservation of energy akin to that of Goethe in poetry, are able
to render a character, coldly indeed, but with matchless
verisimilitude in its every nuance.&nbsp; And there are those
who, like Edmund Kean and Robson, &lsquo;live&rsquo; in the
character so entirely that self-dominance and conservation of
energy are not possible, and who, whensoever the situation
becomes very intense, work miracles of representation by sheer
imaginative abandon, but do so at the expense of that delicacy of
light and shade in the entire conception which is the great quest
of the actor as an artist.&nbsp; And if it should be found that
in order to render Triboulet there is requisite for the more
intense crises of the piece the abandon of Kean and Robson, and
at the same time, for the carrying on of the play, the calm,
self-conscious staying power of Garrick, the conclusion will be
obvious that Triboulet is essentially an unactable
character.&nbsp; I will illustrate this by an instance.&nbsp; The
reader will remember that in <a name="page128"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 128</span>the third act of &lsquo;Le Roi
s&rsquo;Amuse,&rsquo; Triboulet&rsquo;s daughter Blanche, after
having been violated by the king at the Louvre, rushes into the
antechamber, where stands her father surrounded by the group of
sneering courtiers who, unknown both to the king and to
Triboulet, have abducted her during the night and set her in the
king&rsquo;s way.&nbsp; When the girl tells her father of the
terrible wrong that has been done to her, he passes at once from
the mood of sardonic defiance which was natural to him into a
state of passion so terrible that a sudden and magical effect is
produced: the conventional walls between him, the poor despised
court jester, and the courtiers, are suddenly overthrown by the
unexpected operation of one of those great human instincts which
make the whole world kin:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Triboulet</span> (faisant trois pas, et

<p>Now in reading &lsquo;Le Roi s&rsquo;Amuse,&rsquo; startling
as is the situation, it does not seem exaggerated, for Victor
Hugo&rsquo;s lines are adequate in simple passion to effect the
dramatic work, and the reader feels that Triboulet was wrought up
to the state of exaltation to which the lines give expression, <a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>that
nothing could resist him, and that the proud courtiers must in
truth have cowered before him in the manner here indicated by the
dramatist.&nbsp; In literature the artist does not actualize; he
suggests, and leaves the reader&rsquo;s imagination free.&nbsp;
But an actor has to actualize this state of exaltation&mdash;he
has to bring the physical condition answering to the emotional
condition before the eyes of the spectator; and if he fails to
display as much of the &lsquo;fine frenzy&rsquo; of passion as is
requisite to cow and overawe a group of cynical worldlings, the
situation becomes forced and unnatural, inasmuch as they are
overawed without a sufficient cause.&nbsp; That an actor like
Robson could and would have risen to such an occasion no one will
doubt who ever saw him (for he was the very incarnation of the
romantic temper), but then the exhaustion would have been so
great that it would have been impossible for him to go on bearing
the entire weight of this long play as M. Got does.&nbsp; The
actor requires, as I say, the abandon characteristic of one kind
of histrionic art together with the staying power characteristic
of another.&nbsp; Now, admirable as is M. Got in this and in all
scenes of &lsquo;Le Roi s&rsquo;Amuse,&rsquo; he does not pass
into such a condition of exalted passion as makes the retirement
of the courtiers seem probable.&nbsp; For artistic perfection
there was nothing in the entire representation that surpassed the
scenes between Saltabadil and Maguelonne in the hovel on the
banks of the Seine.&nbsp; It would be difficult, indeed, to
decide which was the more admirable, the Saltabadil of M. Febvre
or the Maguelonne of Jeanne Samary.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I may mention here that Mr. Watts-Dunton has always shown the
greatest admiration of the actor&rsquo;s art and the greatest
interest in actors and actresses.&nbsp; He has affirmed that
&lsquo;the one great art in which women are as essential as
men&mdash;the one great art in which their place can never be
supplied by men&mdash;is in the acted drama, which the Greeks
held in such high esteem that &AElig;schylus and Sophocles acted
as stage managers and show-masters, although the stage mask
dispensed with much of the necessity of calling in the aid of
women.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Great as is the importance of female poets,&rsquo; says
Mr. Watts-Dunton, &lsquo;men are so rich in endowment, that
literature would be a worthy expression of the human mind if
there had been no Sappho and no Emily Bront&euml;&mdash;no Mrs.
Browning&mdash;no Christina Rossetti.&nbsp; Great as is the
importance of female novelists, men again are so rich in
endowment that literature would be a worthy expression of the
human mind if there had been no Georges Sand, no Jane Austen, no
Charlotte Bront&euml;, no George Eliot, no Mrs. Gaskell, no Mrs.
Craigie.&nbsp; As to painting and music, up to now women have not
been notable workers in either of these departments,
notwithstanding <a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>Rosa Bonheur and one or two others.&nbsp; But, to say
nothing of France, what in England would have been the acted
drama, whether in prose or verse, without Mrs. Siddons, Mrs.
Hermann Vezin, Adelaide Neilson, Miss Glyn, in tragedy; without
Mrs. Bracegirdle, Kitty Clive, Julia Neilson, Ellen Terry, Irene
Vanbrugh and Ada Rehan in comedy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>People who run down actresses should say at once that the
acted drama is not one of the fine arts at all.&nbsp; Mr.
Watts-Dunton has often expressed the opinion that there is in
England a great waste of histrionic endowment among women, owing
to the ignorant prejudice against the stage which even now is
prevalent in England.&nbsp; &lsquo;An enormous waste of
force,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;there is, of course, in other
departments of intellectual activity, but nothing like the waste
of latent histrionic powers among Englishwomen.&rsquo;&nbsp; And
he supplies many examples of this which have come under his own
observation, among which I can mention only one.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some years ago,&rsquo; he said to me, &lsquo;I was
invited to go to see the performance of a French play given by
the pupils of a fashionable school in the West End of
London.&nbsp; Apart from the admirable French accent of the girls
I was struck by the acting of two or three performers who showed
some latent dramatic talent.&nbsp; I have always taken an
interest in amateur dramatic performances, for a reason that Lady
Archibald Campbell in one of her writings has well discussed,
namely, that what the amateur actor or actress may lack in
knowledge of stage traditions he or she will sometimes more than
make up for by the sweet flexibility and abandon of nature.&nbsp;
The amateur will often achieve that rarest of all artistic
excellencies, whether in poetry, painting, sculpture, music, or
histrionics&mdash;<a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>na&iuml;vet&eacute;: a quality which in poetry is seen
in its perfection in the finest of the writings of Coleridge; in
acting, it is perhaps seen in its perfection in Duse.&nbsp; Now,
on the occasion to which I refer, one of these schoolgirl
actresses achieved, as I thought, and as others thought with me,
this rare and perfect flower of histrionics; and when I came to
know her I found that she joined wide culture and an immense
knowledge of Shakespeare, Corneille, Racine, and Moli&egrave;re
with an innate gift for rendering them.&nbsp; In any other
society than that of England she would have gone on the stage as
a matter of course, but the fatal prejudice about social position
prevented her from following the vocation that Nature intended
for her.&nbsp; Since then I have seen two or three such cases,
not so striking as this one, but striking enough to make me angry
with Philistinism.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With this sympathy for histrionic art, it is not at all
surprising that Mr. Watts-Dunton took the greatest interest in
the open-air plays organized by Lady Archibald Campbell at
Coombe.&nbsp; I have seen a brilliant description of these plays
by him which ought to have been presented to the public years
ago.&nbsp; It forms, I believe, a long chapter of an unpublished
novel.&nbsp; Turning over the pages of Davenport Adams&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Dictionary of the Drama,&rsquo; which every lover of the
theatre must regret he did not live to complete, I come
accidentally upon these words: &ldquo;One of the most recently
printed epilogues is that which Theodore Watts-Dunton wrote for
an amateur performance of Banville&rsquo;s &lsquo;Le
Baiser&rsquo; at Coombe, Surrey, in August, 1889.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And this reminds me that I ought to quote this famous epilogue
here; for Professor Strong in his review of &lsquo;The Coming of
Love&rsquo; in &lsquo;Literature&rsquo; speaks of the amazing
command over metre and colour and story displayed in <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>the
poem.&nbsp; It is, I believe, the only poem in the English
language in which an elaborate story is fully told by poetic
suggestion instead of direct statement.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">A REMINISCENCE OF THE
OPEN-AIR PLAYS.</p>
<p>Epilogue for the open-air performance of Banville&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Le Baiser, in which Lady Archibald Campbell took the part
of &lsquo;Pierrot&rsquo; and Miss Annie Schletter the part of the
&lsquo;Fairy.&rsquo;&mdash;Coombe, August 9, 1889.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To Pierrot in
Love</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center">The Clown whose kisses turned a
Crone to a Fairy-queen</p>
<p>What dost thou here in Love&rsquo;s enchanted wood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pierrot, who once wert safe as clown and
thief&mdash;<br />
Held safe by love of fun and wine and food&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From her who follows love of Woman, Grief&mdash;<br
/>
Her who of old stalked over Eden-grass<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind Love&rsquo;s baby-feet&mdash;whose shadow
threw<br />
On every brook, as on a magic glass,<br />
Prophetic shapes of what should come to pass<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When tears got mixt with Paradisal dew?</p>
<p>Kisses are loved but for the lips that kiss:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thine have restored a princess to her throne,<br />
Breaking the spell which barred from fairy bliss<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A fay, and shrank her to a wrinkled crone;<br />
But, if thou dream&rsquo;st that thou from Pantomime<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shalt clasp an angel of the mystic moon,<br />
Clasp her on banks of Love&rsquo;s own rose and thyme,<br />
While woodland warblers ring the nuptial-chime&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bottom to thee were but a week buffoon.</p>
<p>When yonder fairy, long ago, was told<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The spell which caught her in malign eclipse,<br />
Turning her radiant body foul and old,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Would yield to some knight-errant&rsquo;s virgin
lips,<br />
And when, through many a weary day and night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She, wondering who the paladin would be<br />
Whose kiss should charm her from her grievous plight,<br />
Pictured a-many princely heroes bright,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dost thou suppose she ever pictured thee?</p>
<p><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>&rsquo;Tis true the mischief of the foeman&rsquo;s
charm<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yielded to thee&mdash;to that first kiss of
thine.<br />
We saw her tremble&mdash;lift a rose-wreath arm,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which late, all veined and shrivelled, made her
pine;<br />
We saw her fingers rise and touch her cheek,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As if the morning breeze across the wood,<br />
Which lately seemed to strike so chill and bleak<br />
Through all the wasted body, bent and weak,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were light and music now within her blood.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis true thy kiss made all her form expand&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Made all the skin grow smooth and pure as pearl,<br
/>
Till there she stood, tender, yet tall and grand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A queen of Faery, yet a lovesome girl,<br />
Within whose eyes&mdash;whose wide, new-litten eyes&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; New-litten by thy kiss&rsquo;s re-creation&mdash;<br
/>
Expectant joy that yet was wild surprise<br />
Made all her flesh like light of summer skies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When dawn lies dreaming of the morn&rsquo;s
carnation.</p>
<p>But when thou saw&rsquo;st the breaking of the spell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Within whose grip of might her soul had pined,<br />
Like some sweet butterfly that breaks the cell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In which its purple pinions slept confined,<br />
And when thou heard&rsquo;st the strains of elfin song<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her sisters sang from rainbow cars above
her&mdash;<br />
Didst thou suppose that she, though prisoned long,<br />
And freed at last by thee from all the wrong,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Must for that kiss take Harlequin for lover?</p>
<p>Hearken, sweet fool!&nbsp; Though Banville carried thee<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To lawns where love and song still share the
sward<br />
Beyond the golden river few can see,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And fewer still, in these grey days, can ford;<br />
And though he bade the wings of Passion fan<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy face, till every line grows bright and human,<br
/>
Feathered thy spirit&rsquo;s wing for wider span,<br />
And fired thee with the fire that comes to man<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When first he plucks the rose of Nature, Woman;</p>
<p><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>And
though our actress gives thee that sweet gaze<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where spirit and matter mingle in liquid
blue&mdash;<br />
That face, where pity through the frolic plays&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That form, whose lines of light Love&rsquo;s pencil
drew&mdash;<br />
That voice whose music seems a new caress<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever passion makes a new transition<br />
From key to key of joy or quaint distress&mdash;<br />
That sigh, when, now, thy fairy&rsquo;s loveliness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Leaves thee alone to mourn Love&rsquo;s vanished
vision:</p>
<p>Still art thou Pierrot&mdash;naught but Pierrot ever;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For is not this the very word of Fate:<br />
&lsquo;No mortal, clown or king, shall e&rsquo;er dissever<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His present glory from his past estate&rsquo;?<br />
Yet be thou wise and dry those foolish tears;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The clown&rsquo;s first kiss was needed, not the
clown,<br />
By her, who, fired by hopes and chilled by fears,<br />
Sought but a kiss like thine for years on years:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Be wise, I say, and wander back to town.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Recurring to the Marston gatherings, I reproduce here, from
the same unpublished story to which I have already alluded, the
following interesting account of them and of other social
reunions of the like kind.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Many of those who have reached life&rsquo;s
meridian, or passed it, will remember the sudden rise, a quarter
of a century ago, of Rossetti, Swinburne, and William
Morris&mdash;poets who seemed for a time to threaten the
ascendency of Tennyson himself.&nbsp; Between this galaxy and the
latest generation of poets there rose, culminated, and apparently
set, another&mdash;the group which it was the foolish fashion to
call &lsquo;the pre-Raphaelite poets,&rsquo; some of whom
yielded, or professed to yield, to the influence of Rossetti,
some to that of William Morris, and some to that of
Swinburne.&nbsp; Round them all, however, there was the aura of
Baudelaire or else of Gautier.&nbsp; These&mdash;though, as in
all such <a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>cases, nature had really made them very unlike each
other&mdash;formed themselves into a set, or rather a sect, and
tried apparently to become as much like each other as possible,
by studying French models, selecting subjects more or less in
harmony with the French temper, getting up their books after the
fashion that was as much approved then as contemporary fashions
in books are approved now, and by various other means.&nbsp; They
had certain places of meeting, where they held high converse with
themselves.&nbsp; One of these was the hospitable house, in
Fitzroy Square, of the beloved and venerable painter, Mr. Madox
Brown, whose face, as he sat smiling upon his Eisteddfod,
radiating benevolence and encouragement to the unfledged bards he
loved, was a picture which must be cherished in many a grateful
memory now.&nbsp; Another was the equally hospitable house, in
the neighbourhood of Chalk Farm, where reigned the dramatist,
Westland Marston, and where his blind poet-boy Philip
lived.&nbsp; Here O&rsquo;Shaughnessy would come with a glow of
triumph on his face, which indicated clearly enough what he was
carrying in his pocket&mdash;something connecting him with the
divine Th&eacute;ophile&mdash;a letter from the Gallic Olympus
perhaps, or a presentation copy sent from the very top of the
Gallic Parnassus.&nbsp; It was on one of these occasions that
Rossetti satirically advised one of the cenacle to quit so poor a
language as that of Shakespeare and write entirely in French,
which language Morris immediately defined as &lsquo;nosey
Latin.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is a pity that some literary veteran does
not give his reminiscences of those Marston nights, or rather
Marston mornings, for the symposium began at about twelve and
went on till nearly six&mdash;those famous gatherings of poets,
actors, and painters, enlinking the days of Macready, Phelps,
Miss Glyn, Robert Browning, Dante Rossetti, and R. H. <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>Horne, with
the days of poets, actors, and painters like Mr. Swinburne,
Morris, and Mr. Irving.&nbsp; Yet these pre-Raphaelite bards had
another joy surpassing even that of the Chalk Farm symposium,
that of assisting at those literary and artistic feasts which
Rossetti used occasionally to give at Cheyne Walk.&nbsp;
Generosity and geniality incarnate was the mysterious
poet-painter to those he loved; and if the budding bard yearned
for sympathy, as he mostly does, he could get quite as much as he
deserved, and more, at 16 Cheyne Walk.&nbsp; To say that any
artist could take a deeper interest in the work of a friend than
in his own seems bold, yet it could be said of Rossetti.&nbsp;
The mean rivalries of the literary character that so often make
men experienced in the world shrink away from it, found no place
in that great heart.&nbsp; To hear him recite in his musical
voice the sonnet or lyric of some unknown bard or
bardling&mdash;recite it in such a way as to lend the lines the
light and music of his own marvellous genius, while the bard or
bardling listened with head bowed low, so that the flush on his
cheek and the moisture in his eye should not be seen&mdash;this
was an experience that did indeed make the bardic life
&lsquo;worth living.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

While that sweet music echoes like a moan<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the island&rsquo;s heart, and sighs around the
lake,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where, watching fearfully a watchful snake,<br />
A damsel weeps upon her emerald throne.</p>
<p>Life&rsquo;s ocean, breaking round thy senses&rsquo; shore,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; Struck golden song, as from the strand of Day:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For us the joy, for thee the fell foe lay&mdash;<br

Pain&rsquo;s blinking snake around the fair isle&rsquo;s core,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning to sighs the enchanted sounds that play<br

Around thy lovely island evermore.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am now brought to a portion of my study which may well give
me pause&mdash;the relations between Mr. Watts-Dunton and
Rossetti.&nbsp; The latest remarks upon them are, I think, the
best; they are by Mr. A. C. Benson in his monograph on Rossetti
in the &lsquo;English Men of Letters&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It would be impossible to exaggerate the
value of his friendship for Rossetti.&nbsp; Mr. Watts-Dunton
understood him, sympathized with him, and with self-denying and
unobtrusive delicacy shielded him, so far as any one can be
shielded, from the rough contact of the world.&nbsp; <a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>It was for
a long time hoped that Mr. Watts-Dunton would give the memoir of
his great friend to the world, but there is such a thing as
knowing a man too well to be his biographer.&nbsp; It is,
however, an open secret that a vivid sketch of Rossetti&rsquo;s
personality has been given to the world in Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s well-known romance &lsquo;Aylwin,&rsquo;
where the artist D&rsquo;Arcy is drawn from Rossetti. . . .&nbsp;
Though singularly independent in judgment, it is clear that, at
all events in the later years of his life, Rossetti&rsquo;s taste
was, unconsciously, considerably affected by the critical
preferences of Mr. Watts-Dunton.&nbsp; I have heard it said by
one <a name="citation139"></a><a href="#footnote139"
class="citation">[139]</a> who knew them both well that it was
often enough for Mr. Watts-Dunton to express a strong opinion for
Rossetti to adopt it as his own, even though he might have
combated it for the moment. . . .</p>
<p>At the end of each part [of &lsquo;Rose Mary&rsquo;] comes a
curious lyrical outburst called the Beryl-songs, the chant of the
imprisoned spirits, which are intended to weld the poem together
and to supply connections.&nbsp; It is said that Mr.
Watts-Dunton, when he first read the poem in proof, said to
Rossetti that the drift was too intricate for an ordinary
reader.&nbsp; Rossetti took this to heart, and wrote the
Beryl-songs to bridge the gaps; Mr. Watts-Dunton, on being shown
them, very rightly disapproved, and said humorously that they
turned a fine ballad into a bastard opera.&nbsp; Rossetti, who
was ill at the time, was so much disconcerted and upset at the
criticism, that Mr. Watts-Dunton modified his judgment, and the
interludes were printed.&nbsp; But at a later day Rossetti
himself <a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>came round to the opinion that they were
inappropriate.&nbsp; They are curiously wrought, rhapsodical,
irregular songs, with fantastic rhymes, and were better away. . .
.</p>
<p>Then he began to settle down into the production of the
single-figure pictures, of which Mr. Watts-Dunton wrote that
&lsquo;apart from any question of technical shortcomings, one of
Rossetti&rsquo;s strongest claims to the attention of posterity
was that of having invented, in the three-quarter length pictures
painted from one face, a type of female beauty which was akin to
none other, which was entirely new, in short&mdash;and which, for
wealth of sublime and mysterious suggestion, unaided by complex
dramatic design, was unique in the art of the world.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>It is well known that Rossetti wished his life&mdash;if
written at all&mdash;to be written by Mr. Watts-Dunton, unless
his brother should undertake it.&nbsp; It is also well known that
the brother himself wished it, but pressure of other matters
prevented Mr. Watts-Dunton from undertaking it.&nbsp; I expected
difficulties in approaching with regard to the delicate subject
of his relations with Rossetti, but I was not prepared to find
them so great as they have proved to be.&nbsp; When I wrote to
him and asked him whether the portrait of D&rsquo;Arcy in
&lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; was to be accepted as a portrait of
Rossetti, and when I asked him to furnish me with some materials
and facts to form the basis of this chapter, I received from him
the following letter:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Mr.
Douglas</span>,&mdash;I have never myself affirmed that
D&rsquo;Arcy was to be taken as an actual portrait of
Rossetti.&nbsp; Even if I thought that a portrait of him could be
given in any form of imaginative literature, <a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>I have
views of my own as to the propriety of giving actual portraits of
men with whom a novelist or poet has been brought into
contact.&nbsp; It is quite impossible for an imaginative writer
to avoid the imperious suggestions of his memory when he is
conceiving a character.&nbsp; Thousands of times in a year does
one come across critical remarks upon the prototypes of the
characters of such great novelists as Scott, Dickens, Thackeray,
the Bront&euml;s, George Eliot, George Meredith, Thomas Hardy,
and the rest.&nbsp; And I believe that every one of these writers
would confess that his prominent characters were suggested to him
by living individuals or by individuals who figure in
history&mdash;but suggested only.&nbsp; And as to the ethics of
so dealing with friends and acquaintances I have also views of my
own.&nbsp; These are easily stated.&nbsp; The closer the
imaginative writer gets to the portrait of a friend, or even of
an acquaintance, the more careful must he be to set his subject
in a genial and even a generous light.&nbsp; It would be a
terrible thing if every man who has been a notable figure in life
were to be represented as this or that at the sweet will of
everybody who has known him.&nbsp; Generous treatment, I say, is
demanded of every writer who makes use of the facets of character
that have struck him in his intercourse with friend or
acquaintance.&nbsp; I will give you an instance of this.&nbsp;
When I drew De Castro in &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; I made use of my
knowledge of a certain individual.&nbsp; Now this individual,
although a man of quite extraordinary talents, brilliance, and
personal charm, bore not a very good name, because he was driven
to live upon his wits.&nbsp; He had endowments so great and so
various that I cannot conceive any line of life in which he was
not fitted to excel&mdash;but it was his irreparable misfortune
to have been trained to no business and no profession, and to
have been <a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>thrown upon the world without means, and without useful
family connections.&nbsp; Such a man must either sink beneath the
oceanic waves of London life, or he must make a struggle to live
upon his wits.&nbsp; This individual made that struggle&mdash;he
struck out with a vigour that, as far as I know, was without
example in London society.&nbsp; He got to know, and to know
intimately, men like Ruskin, G. F. Watts, D. G. Rossetti, Mr. W.
M. Rossetti, William Morris, Mr. Swinburne, Sir Edward Burne
Jones, Cruikshank, and I know not what important people
besides.&nbsp; When he was first brought into touch with the
painters, he knew nothing whatever of art; in two or three years,
as I have heard Rossetti say, he was a splendid
&lsquo;connoisseur.&rsquo;&nbsp; If he had been brought up as a
lawyer he must have risen to the top of the profession.&nbsp; If
he had been brought up as an actor he must, as I have heard a
dramatist say, have risen to the top.&nbsp; But from his very
first appearance in London he was driven to live upon his
wits.&nbsp; And here let me say that this man, who was a bitter
unfriend of my own, because I was compelled to stand in the way
of certain dealings of his, but whom I really could have liked if
he had not been obliged to live upon his wits at the expense of
certain friends of mine, formed the acquaintance of the great men
I have enumerated, not so much from worldly motives, as I
believe, as from real admiration.&nbsp; But being driven to live
upon his wits, he had not sufficient moral strength to afford a
conscience, and the queerest stories were told&mdash;some of them
true enough&mdash;of his dealings with those great men.&nbsp;
Whistler&rsquo;s anecdotes of him at one period set many a table
in a roar; and yet so winsome was the man that after a time he
became as intimate with Whistler as ever.&nbsp; If he had
possessed a private income, and if that income had been carefully
settled upon him, I believe <a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>he would have been one of the most
honest of men; I know he would have been one of the most
generous.&nbsp; His conduct to the late Treffry Dunn, from whom
he could not have expected the least return except that of
gratitude, was proof enough of his generosity.&nbsp; Of course to
make use of so strange a character as this was a great temptation
to me when I wrote &lsquo;Aylwin.&rsquo;&nbsp; But in what has
been called my &lsquo;thumb-nail portrait of him,&rsquo; I
treated the peccadilloes attributed to him in a playful and
jocose way.&nbsp; It would have been quite wrong to have painted
otherwise than in playful colours a character like this.&nbsp;
Like every other man and woman in this world, he left behind him
people who believed in him and loved him.&nbsp; It would have
been cruel to wound these, and unfair to the man; and yet because
I gave only a slight suggestion of his sublime quackery and
supreme blarney, a writer who also knew something about him, but
of course not a thousandth part of what I knew, said that I had
tried my hand at depicting him in &lsquo;Aylwin,&rsquo; but with
no great success.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, I did not attempt to
give a portrait of him: I simply used certain facets of his
character to work out my story, and then dismissed him.&nbsp; On
the other hand, where the character of a friend or acquaintance
is noble, the imagination can work more freely&mdash;as in the
case of Philip Aylwin, Cyril Aylwin, Wilderspin, Rhona Boswell,
Winifred Wynne, Sinfi Lovell.&nbsp; And as to Rossetti, whom I
have been charged by certain critics with having idealized in my
picture of D&rsquo;Arcy, all I have to say on that point is
this&mdash;that if the noble and fascinating qualities which
Rossetti showed had been leavened with mean ones I should not, in
introducing his character into a story, have considered it right
or fair or generous to dwell upon those mean ones.&nbsp; But as a
matter of <a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>fact, during my whole intercourse with him he displayed
no such qualities.&nbsp; The D&rsquo;Arcy that I have painted is
not one whit nobler, more magnanimous, wide-minded, and generous,
than was D. G. Rossetti.&nbsp; As I have said on several
occasions, he could and did take as deep an interest in a
friend&rsquo;s work as in his own.&nbsp; And to benefit a friend
was the greatest pleasure he had in life.&nbsp; I loved the man
so deeply that I should never have introduced D&rsquo;Arcy into
the novel had it not been in the hope of silencing the
misrepresentations of him that began as soon as ever Rossetti was
laid in the grave at Birchington, by depicting his character in
colours as true as they were sympathetic.&nbsp; It has been the
grievous fate of Rossetti to be the victim of an amount of
detraction which is simply amazing and inscrutable.&nbsp; I
cannot in the least understand why this is so.&nbsp; It is the
great sorrow of my life.&nbsp; There is a fatality of detraction
about his name which in its unreasonableness would be grotesque
were it not heartrending.&nbsp; It would turn my natural optimism
about mankind into pessimism were it not that another dear friend
of mine&mdash;a man of equal nobility of character, and almost of
equal genius, has escaped calumny altogether&mdash;William
Morris.&nbsp; This matter is a painful puzzle to me.&nbsp; The
only great man of my time who seems to have shared something of
Rossetti&rsquo;s fate, is Lord Tennyson.&nbsp; There seems to be
a general desire to belittle him, to exaggerate such angularities
as were his, and to speak of that almost childlike simplicity of
character which was an ineffable charm in him as springing from
boorishness and almost from loutishness.&nbsp; On the other hand,
another great genius, Browning, for whom I had and have the
greatest admiration, seems to be as fortunate as Morris in
escaping the detractor.&nbsp; But I am wandering from
Rossetti.&nbsp; I do not <a name="page145"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>feel any impulse to write
reminiscences of him.&nbsp; Too much has been written about him
already&mdash;of late a great deal too much.&nbsp; The only thing
written about him that has given me comfort&mdash;I may say joy,
is this&mdash;it has been written by a man who knew him before I
did, who knew him at the time he lost his wife.&nbsp; Mr. Val
Prinsep, R.A., has declared that in Rossetti&rsquo;s relations
with his wife there was nothing whatever upon which his
conscience might reasonably trouble him.&nbsp; I do not remember
the exact words, but this was the substance of them.&nbsp; Mr.
Val Prinsep is a man of the highest standing, and he knew
Rossetti intimately, and he has declared in print that Rossetti
could have had no qualms of conscience in regard to his relations
with his wife.&nbsp; This, I say, is a source of great comfort to
me and to all who loved Rossetti.&nbsp; That he was whimsical,
fanciful, and at times most troublesome to his friends, no one
knows better than I do.</p>
<p>No one, I say, is more competent to speak of the whims and the
fancies and the troublesomeness of Rossetti than I am; and yet I
say that he was one of the noblest-hearted men of his time, and
lovable&mdash;most lovable.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would be worse than idle to enter at this time of day upon
the painful subject of the &ldquo;Buchanan affair.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Indeed, I have often thought it is a great pity that it is not
allowed to die out.&nbsp; The only reason why it is still kept
alive seems to be that, without discussing it, it is impossible
fully to understand Rossetti&rsquo;s nervous illness, about which
so much has been said.&nbsp; I remember seeing in Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s essay on Congreve in &lsquo;Chambers&rsquo;s
Encyclop&aelig;dia&rsquo; a definition of envy as the
&lsquo;literary leprosy.&rsquo;&nbsp; This phrase has often been
quoted in reference <a name="page146"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 146</span>to the case of Buchanan, and also in
reference to a recent and much more ghastly case between two
intimate friends.&nbsp; Now, with all deference to Mr.
Watts-Dunton, I cannot accept it as a right and fair
definition.&nbsp; It is a fact no doubt that the struggle in the
world of art&mdash;whether poetry, music, painting, sculpture, or
the drama&mdash;is unlike that of the mere strivers after wealth
and position, inasmuch as to praise one man&rsquo;s artistic work
is in a certain way to set it up against the work of
another.&nbsp; Still, one can realize, without referring to
Disraeli&rsquo;s &lsquo;Curiosities of Literature,&rsquo; that
envy is much too vigorous in the artistic life.&nbsp; Now,
whatever may have been the good qualities of Buchanan&mdash;and I
know he had many good qualities&mdash;it seems unfortunately to
be true that he was afflicted with this terrible disease of
envy.&nbsp; There can be no question that what incited him to
write the notorious article in the &lsquo;Contemporary
Review&rsquo; entitled &lsquo;The Fleshly School of
Poetry,&rsquo; was simply envy&mdash;envy and nothing else.&nbsp;
It was during the time that Rossetti was suffering most
dreadfully from the mental disturbance which seems really to have
originated in this attack and the cognate attacks which appeared
in certain other magazines, that the intimacy between Mr.
Watts-Dunton and Rossetti was formed and cemented.&nbsp; And it
is to this period that Mr. William Rossetti alludes in the
following words: &ldquo;&lsquo;Watts is a hero of
friendship&rsquo; was, according to Mr. Caine, one of my
brother&rsquo;s last utterances, easy enough to be
credited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That he deserved these words I think none will deny; and that
the friendship sprang from the depths of the nature of a man to
whom the word &lsquo;friendship&rsquo; meant not what it
generally means now, a languid sentiment, but what it meant in
Shakespeare&rsquo;s time, a deep passion, is shown by what some
deem the finest lines Mr. Watts-Dunton <a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>ever
wrote&mdash;I mean those lines which he puts into the mouth of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s Friend in &lsquo;Christmas at the
Mermaid,&rsquo; lines part of which have been admirably turned
into Latin by Mr. E. D. Stone, <a name="citation147"></a><a

<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&lsquo;MR. W.
H.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To sing the nation&rsquo;s song or do the deed<br />
That crowns with richer light the motherland,<br />
Or lend her strength of arm in hour of need<br />
When fangs of foes shine fierce on every hand,<br />
Is joy to him whose joy is working well&mdash;<br />
Is goal and guerdon too, though never fame.<br />
<a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>Should
find a thrill of music in his name;<br />
Yea, goal and guerdon too, though Scorn should aim<br />
Her arrows at his soul&rsquo;s high citadel.</p>
<p>But if the fates withhold the joy from me<br />
To do the deed that widens England&rsquo;s day,<br />
Or join that song of Freedom&rsquo;s jubilee<br />
Begun when England started on her way&mdash;<br />
Withhold from me the hero&rsquo;s glorious power<br />
To strike with song or sword for her, the mother,<br />
And give that sacred guerdon to another,<br />
Him will I hail as my more noble brother&mdash;<br />
Him will I love for his diviner dower.</p>
<p>Enough for me who have our Shakspeare&rsquo;s love<br />
To see a poet win the poet&rsquo;s goal,<br />
For Will is he; enough and far above<br />
All other prizes to make rich my soul.<br />
Ben names my numbers golden.&nbsp; Since they tell<br />
A tale of him who in his peerless prime<br />
Fled us ere yet one shadowy film of time<br />
Could dim the lustre of that brow sublime,<br />
Golden my numbers are: Ben praiseth well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems to me to be needful to bear in mind these lines, and
the extremely close intimacy between these two poet-friends in
order to be able to forgive entirely the unexampled scourging of
Buchanan in the following sonnet if, as some writers think,
Buchanan was meant:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">THE OCTOPUS OF THE
GOLDEN ISLES<br />
&lsquo;<span class="smcap">what! will they even strike at
me</span>?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Round many an Isle of Song, in seas serene,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With many a swimmer strove the poet-boy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet strove in love: their strength, I say, was
joy<br />
To him, my friend&mdash;dear friend of godlike mien!<br />
But soon he felt beneath the billowy green<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A monster moving&mdash;moving to destroy:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Limb after limb became the tortured toy<br />
Of coils that clung and lips that stung unseen.</p>
<p><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>&ldquo;And canst thou strike ev&rsquo;n me?&rdquo; the
swimmer said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As rose above the waves the deadly eyes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Arms flecked with mouths that kissed in hellish
wise,<br />
Quivering in hate around a hateful head.&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw him fight old Envy&rsquo;s sorceries:<br />
I saw him sink: the man I loved is dead!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here we get something quite new in satire&mdash;something in
which poetry, fancy, hatred, and contempt, are mingled.&nbsp; The
sonnet appeared first in the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um,&rsquo; and
afterwards in &lsquo;The Coming of Love.&rsquo;&nbsp; If Buchanan
or any special individual was meant, I doubt whether any man has
a moral right to speak about another man in such terms as
these.</p>
<p>All the friends of Rossetti have remarked upon the
extraordinary influence exercised upon him by Mr.
Watts-Dunton.&nbsp; Lady Mount Temple, a great friend of the
painter-poet, used to tell how when she was in his studio and
found him in a state of great dejection, as was so frequently the
case, she would notice that Rossetti&rsquo;s face would suddenly
brighten up on hearing a light footfall in the hall&mdash;the
footfall of his friend, who had entered with his
latch-key&mdash;and how from that moment Rossetti would be
another man.&nbsp; Rossetti&rsquo;s own relatives have recorded
the same influence.&nbsp; I have often thought that the most
touching thing in Mr. W. M. Rossetti&rsquo;s beautiful monograph
of his brother is the following extract from his aged
mother&rsquo;s diary at Birchington-on-Sea, when the poet is
dying:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;March 28, Tuesday.&nbsp; Mr. Watts came
down; Gabriel rallied marvellously.</p>
<p>This is the last cheerful item which it is allowed me to
record concerning my brother; I am glad that it stands associated
with the name of Theodore Watts.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>Here
is another excerpt from the brother&rsquo;s diary:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Gabriel had, just before Shields entered
the drawing-room for me, given two violent cries, and had a
convulsive fit, very sharp and distorting the face, followed by
collapse.&nbsp; All this passed without my personal
cognizance.&nbsp; He died 9.31 p.m.; the others&mdash;Watts,
mother, Christina, and nurse, in room; Caine and Shields in and
out; Watts at Gabriel&rsquo;s right side, partly supporting
him.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s influence over Rossetti extended
even to his art as a poet is shown by Mr. Benson&rsquo;s words
already quoted.&nbsp; I must also quote the testimony of Mr. Hall
Caine, who says, in his &lsquo;Recollections&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Rossetti, throughout the period of my
acquaintance with him, seemed to me always peculiarly and, if I
may be permitted to say so without offence, strangely liable to
Mr. Watts&rsquo; influence in his critical estimates; and the
case instanced was perhaps the only one in which I knew him to
resist Mr. Watts&rsquo;s opinion upon a matter of poetical
criticism, which he considered to be almost final, as his letters
to me, printed in Chapter VIII of this volume, will show.&nbsp; I
had a striking instance of this, and of the real modesty of the
man whom I had heard and still hear spoken of as the most
arrogant man of genius of his day, on one of the first occasions
of my seeing him.&nbsp; He read out to me an additional stanza to
the beautiful poem &lsquo;Cloud Confines.&rsquo;&nbsp; As he read
it, I thought it very fine, and he evidently was very fond of it
himself.&nbsp; But he surprised me by saying that he should not
print it.&nbsp; On my asking him why, he said:</p>
<p><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>&lsquo;Watts, though he admits its beauty, thinks the
poem would be better without it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, but you like it yourself,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;but in a question of
gain or loss to a poem I feel that Watts must be
right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And the poem appeared in &lsquo;Ballads and Sonnets&rsquo;
without the stanza in question.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is another beautiful passage from Mr. Hall Caine&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Recollections&rsquo;&mdash;a passage which speaks as much
for the writer as for the object of his enthusiasm:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As to Mr. Theodore Watts, whose brotherly
devotion to him and beneficial influence over him from that time
forward are so well known, this must be considered by those who
witnessed it to be almost without precedent or parallel even in
the beautiful story of literary friendships, and it does as much
honour to the one as to the other.&nbsp; No light matter it must
have been to lay aside one&rsquo;s own long-cherished life-work
and literary ambitions to be Rossetti&rsquo;s closest friend and
brother, at a moment like the present, when he imagined the world
to be conspiring against him; but through these evil days, and
long after them, down to his death, the friend that clung closer
than a brother was with him, as he himself said, to protect, to
soothe, to comfort, to divert, to interest and inspire
him&mdash;asking, meantime, no better reward than the knowledge
that a noble mind and nature was by such sacrifice lifted out of
sorrow.&nbsp; Among the world&rsquo;s great men the greatest are
sometimes those whose names are least on our lips, and this is
because selfish aims have been so subordinate in their lives to
the welfare of others as to leave no time for the personal
achievements that win personal distinction; but when the world <a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>comes to
the knowledge of the price that has been paid for the devotion
that enables others to enjoy their renown, shall it not reward
with a double meed of gratitude the fine spirits to whom ambition
has been as nothing against fidelity of friendship.&nbsp; Among
the latest words I heard from Rossetti was this: &lsquo;Watts is
a hero of friendship&rsquo;; and indeed, he has displayed his
capacity for participation in the noblest part of comradeship,
that part, namely, which is far above the mere traffic that too
often goes by the name, and wherein self-love always counts upon
being the gainer.&nbsp; If in the end it should appear that he
has in his own person done less than might have been hoped for
from one possessed of his splendid gifts, let it not be
overlooked that he has influenced in a quite incalculable degree,
and influenced for good, several of the foremost among those who
in their turn have influenced the age.&nbsp; As Rossetti&rsquo;s
faithful friend and gifted medical adviser, Mr. John Marshall,
has often declared, there were periods when Rossetti&rsquo;s very
life may be said to have hung upon Mr. Watts&rsquo; power to
cheer and soothe.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This anecdote is also told by Mr. Caine:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Immediately upon the publication of his
first volume, and incited thereto by the early success of it, he
had written the poem &lsquo;Rose Mary,&rsquo; as well as two
lyrics published at the time in &lsquo;The Fortnightly
Review&rsquo;; but he suffered so seriously from the subsequent
assaults of criticism, that he seemed definitely to lay aside all
hope of producing further poetry, and, indeed, to become
possessed of the delusion that he had for ever lost all power of
doing so.&nbsp; It is an interesting fact, well known in his own
literary circle, that his taking up poetry afresh was the result
of a fortuitous occurrence.&nbsp; After one of <a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>his most
serious illnesses, and in the hope of drawing off his attention
from himself, and from the gloomy forebodings which in an
invalid&rsquo;s mind usually gather about his own too absorbing
personality, a friend prevailed upon him, with infinite
solicitation, to try his hand afresh at a sonnet.&nbsp; The
outcome was an effort so feeble as to be all but unrecognizable
as the work of the author of the sonnets of &lsquo;The House of
Life,&rsquo; but, with more shrewdness and friendliness (on this
occasion) than frankness, the critic lavished measureless praise
upon it and urged the poet to renewed exertion.&nbsp; One by one,
at longer or shorter intervals, sonnets were written, and this
exercise did more towards his recovery than any other medicine,
with the result besides that Rossetti eventually regained all his
old dexterity and mastery of hand.&nbsp; The artifice had
succeeded beyond every expectation formed of it, serving, indeed,
the twofold end of improving the invalid&rsquo;s health by
preventing his brooding over unhealthy matters, and increasing
the number of his accomplished works.&nbsp; Encouraged by such
results, the friend went on to induce Rossetti to write a ballad,
and this purpose he finally achieved by challenging the
poet&rsquo;s ability to compose in the simple, direct, and
emphatic style, which is the style of the ballad proper, as
distinguished from the elaborate, ornate, and condensed diction
which he had hitherto worked in.&nbsp; Put upon his mettle, the
outcome of this second artifice practised upon him was that he
wrote &lsquo;The White Ship&rsquo; and afterwards &lsquo;The
King&rsquo;s Tragedy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thus was Rossetti already immersed in this revived occupation
of poetic composition, and had recovered a healthy tone of body,
before he became conscious of what was being done with him.&nbsp;
It is a further amusing fact that one day he requested to be
shown the first <a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>sonnet which, in view of the praise lavished upon it by
the friend on whose judgment he reposed, had encouraged him to
renewed effort.&nbsp; The sonnet was bad: the critic knew it was
bad, and had from the first hour of its production kept it
carefully out of sight, and was now more than ever unwilling to
show it.&nbsp; Eventually, however, by reason of ceaseless
importunity, he returned it to its author, who, upon reading it,
cried: &lsquo;You fraud!&nbsp; You said this sonnet was good, and
it&rsquo;s the worst I ever wrote!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;The worst
ever written would perhaps be a truer criticism,&rsquo; was the
reply, as the studio resounded with a hearty laugh, and the poem
was committed to the flames.&nbsp; It would appear that to this
occurrence we probably owe a large portion of the contents of the
volume of 1881.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. William Rossetti is ever eager to testify to the
beneficent effect of Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s intimacy upon his
brother; and quite lately Madox Brown&rsquo;s grandson, Mr. Ford
Madox Hueffer, who, from his connection with the Rossetti family,
speaks with great authority, wrote: &lsquo;In 1873 came Mr.
Theodore Watts, without whose practical friendship and advice,
and without whose literary aids and sustenance, life would have
been from thenceforth an impracticable affair for
Rossetti.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Hueffer speaks of the great change
that came over Rossetti&rsquo;s work when he wrote &lsquo;The
King&rsquo;s Tragedy&rsquo; and &lsquo;The White
Ship&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It should be pointed out that &lsquo;The
White Ship&rsquo; was one of Rossetti&rsquo;s last works, and
that in it he was aiming at simplicity of narration, under the
advice of Mr. Theodore Watts.&nbsp; In this he was undoubtedly on
the right track, and the &lsquo;rhymed chronicles&rsquo; might
have <a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span>disappeared had Rossetti lived long enough to revise
the poem as sedulously as he did his earlier work, and to revise
it with the knowledge of narrative-technique that the greater
part of the poem shows was coming to be his.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was impossible for a man of genius to live so secluded a
life as Rossetti lived at Cheyne Walk and at Kelmscott for
several years, without wild, unauthenticated stories getting
about concerning him.&nbsp; Among other things Rossetti, whose
courtesy and charm of manner were, I believe, proverbial, was now
charged with a rudeness, or rather boorishness like that which
with equal injustice, apparently, is now being attributed to
Tennyson.&nbsp; Stories got into print about his rude bearing
towards people, sometimes towards ladies of the most exalted
position.&nbsp; And these apocryphal and disparaging legends
would no doubt have been still more numerous and still more
offensive, had it not been for the influence of his watchful and
powerful friend.&nbsp; Here is an interesting letter which
Rossetti addressed to the &lsquo;World,&rsquo; and which shows
the close relations between him and Mr. Watts-Dunton:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;16 <span
class="smcap">Cheyne Walk</span>, <span
class="smcap">Chelsea</span>, S.W.<br />
December 28, 1878.</p>
<p>My attention has been directed to the following paragraph
which has appeared in the newspapers: &lsquo;A very disagreeable
story is told about a neighbour of Mr. Whistler&rsquo;s, whose
works are not exhibited to the vulgar herd; the Princess Louise
in her zeal therefore, graciously sought them at the
artist&rsquo;s studio, but was rebuffed by a &lsquo;Not at
home&rsquo; and an intimation that he was not at the beck and
call of princesses.&nbsp; I trust it is not true,&rsquo;
continues the writer of the paragraph, &lsquo;that so medievally
minded a gentleman is really a stranger <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>to that
generous loyalty to rank and sex, that dignified
obedience,&rsquo; etc.</p>
<p>The story is certainly disagreeable enough; but if I am
pointed out as the &lsquo;near neighbour of Mr.
Whistler&rsquo;s&rsquo; who rebuffed, in this rude fashion, the
Princess Louise, I can only say that it is a canard devoid of the
smallest nucleus of truth.&nbsp; Her Royal Highness has never
called upon me, and I know of only two occasions when she has
expressed a wish to do so.&nbsp; Some years ago Mr. Theodore
Martin spoke to me upon the subject, but I was at that time
engaged upon an important work, and the delays thence arising
caused the matter to slip through.&nbsp; And I heard no more upon
the subject till last summer, when Mr. Theodore Watts told me
that the Princess, in conversation, had mentioned my name to him,
and that he had then assured her that I should feel
&lsquo;honoured and charmed to see her,&rsquo; and suggested her
making an appointment.&nbsp; Her Royal Highness knew that Mr.
Watts, as one of my most intimate friends, would not have thus
expressed himself without feeling fully warranted in so doing;
and had she called she would not, I trust, have found me wanting
in that &lsquo;generous loyalty&rsquo; which is due, not more to
her exalted position, than to her well-known charm of character
and artistic gifts.&nbsp; It is true that I do not run after
great people on account of their mere social position, but I am,
I hope, never rude to them; and the man who could rebuff the
Princess Louise must be a curmudgeon indeed.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">D. G. ROSSETTI.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the very juncture in question Lord Lorne was suddenly and
unexpectedly appointed Governor-General of Canada, and, leaving
England, Her Royal Highness <a name="page157"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 157</span>did not return until
Rossetti&rsquo;s health had somewhat suddenly broken down, and it
was impossible for him to see any but his most intimate
friends.</p>
<p>My account of the friendship between Mr. Watts-Dunton and
Rossetti would not be complete without the poem entitled,
&lsquo;A Grave by the Sea,&rsquo; which I think may be placed
beside Milton&rsquo;s &lsquo;Lycidas,&rsquo; Shelley&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Adonais,&rsquo; Matthew Arnold&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Thyrsis,&rsquo; and Swinburne&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ave Atque
Vale,&rsquo; as one of the noblest elegies in our
literature:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">A GRAVE BY THE SEA</p>
<p style="text-align: center">I</p>
<p>Yon sightless poet <a name="citation157"></a><a
href="#footnote157" class="citation">[157]</a> whom thou
leav&rsquo;st behind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sightless and trembling like a storm-struck tree,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the grave he feels but cannot see,<br />
Save with the vision Sorrow lends the mind,<br />
Is he indeed the loneliest of mankind?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah no!&mdash;For all his sobs, he seems to me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Less lonely standing there, and nearer thee,<br />
Than I&mdash;less lonely, nearer&mdash;standing blind!</p>
<p>Free from the day, and piercing Life&rsquo;s disguise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That needs must partly enveil true heart from
heart,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His inner eyes may see thee as thou art<br />
In Memory&rsquo;s land&mdash;see thee beneath the skies<br />
Lit by thy brow&mdash;by those beloved eyes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While I stand by him in a world apart.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">II</p>
<p>I stand like her who on the glittering Rhine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Saw that strange swan which drew a fa&euml;ry
boat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where shone a knight whose radiant forehead smote<br
/>
Her soul with light and made her blue eyes shine<br />
<a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>For many
a day with sights that seemed divine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till that false swan returned and arched his
throat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In pride, and called him, and she saw him float<br
/>
Adown the stream: I stand like her and pine.</p>
<p>I stand like her, for she, and only she,<br />
Might know my loneliness for want of thee.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Light swam into her soul, she asked not whence,<br
/>
Filled it with joy no clouds of life could smother,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, departing like a vision thence,<br />
Left her more lonely than the blind, my brother.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">III</p>
<p>Last night Death whispered: &lsquo;Death is but the name<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Man gives the Power which lends him life and
light,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, returning past the coast of night,<br />
Takes what it lent to shores from whence it came.<br />
What balm in knowing the dark doth but reclaim<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sun it lent, if day hath taken flight?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Art thou not vanished&mdash;vanished from my
sight&mdash;<br />
Though somewhere shining, vanished all the same?</p>
<p>With Nature dumb, save for the billows&rsquo; moan,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Engirt by men I love, yet desolate&mdash;<br />
Standing with brothers here, yet dazed and lone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; King&rsquo;d by my sorrow, made by grief so great<br
/>
That man&rsquo;s voice murmurs like an insect&rsquo;s
drone&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What balm, I ask, in knowing that Death is Fate?</p>
<p style="text-align: center">IV</p>
<p>Last night Death whispered: &lsquo;Life&rsquo;s purblind
procession,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Flickering with blazon of the human story&mdash;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Time&rsquo;s fen-flame over Death&rsquo;s dark
territory&mdash;<br />
Will leave no trail, no sign of Life&rsquo;s aggression.<br />
Yon moon that strikes the pane, the stars in session,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are weak as Man they mock with fleeting glory.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Since Life is only Death&rsquo;s frail feudatory,<br
/>
How shall love hold of Fate in true possession?&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>I
answered thus: &lsquo;If Friendship&rsquo;s isle of palm<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is but a vision, every loveliest leaf,<br />
Can Knowledge of its mockery soothe and calm<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This soul of mine in this most fiery grief?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If Love but holds of Life through Death in fief,<br
/>
What balm in knowing that Love is Death&rsquo;s&mdash;what
balm?&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">V</p>
<p>Yea, thus I boldly answered Death&mdash;even I<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who have for boon&mdash;who have for deathless
dower&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy love, dear friend, which broods, a magic
power,<br />
Filling with music earth and sea and sky:<br />
&lsquo;O Death,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;not Love, but thou shalt
die;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For, this I know, though thine is now the hour,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thine these angry clouds of doom that lour,<br
/>
Death striking Love but strikes to deify.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Yet while I spoke I sighed in loneliness,<br />
For strange seemed Man, and Life seemed comfortless,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And night, whom we two loved, seemed strange and
dumb;<br />
And, waiting till the dawn the promised sign,<br />
I watched&mdash;I listened for that voice of thine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though Reason said: &lsquo;Nor voice nor face can
come.&rsquo;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Watts-Dunton has written many magnificent sonnets, but the
sonnet in this sequence beginning&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Last night Death whispered: &lsquo;Life&rsquo;s
purblind procession,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is, I think, the finest of them all.&nbsp; The imaginative
conception packed into these fourteen lines is cosmic in its
sweep.&nbsp; In the metrical scheme the feminine rhymes of the
octave play a very important part.&nbsp; They suggest pathetic
suspense, mystery, yearning, hope, fear; they ask, they wonder,
they falter.&nbsp; But in the sestet the words of destiny are
calmly and coldly pronounced, and every rhyme clinches <a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>the voice
of doom, until the uttermost deep of despair is sounded in the
iterated cry of the last line.&nbsp; The craftsmanship throughout
is masterly.&nbsp; There is, indeed, one line which is not
unworthy of being ranked with the great lines of English
poetry:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yon moon that strikes the pane, the stars in
session.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here by a bold use of the simple verb &lsquo;strikes&rsquo; a
whole poem is hammered into six words.&nbsp; As to the
interesting question of feminine rhymes, while I admit that they
should never be used without an emotional mandate, I think that
here it is overwhelming.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I have tried to show the beauty of the friendship between
these two rare spirits by means of other testimony than my own,
for although I have been granted the honour of knowing
Rossetti&rsquo;s &lsquo;friend of friends,&rsquo; I missed the
equal honour of knowing Rossetti, save through that &lsquo;friend
of friends.&rsquo;&nbsp; But to know Mr. Watts-Dunton seems
almost like knowing Rossetti, for when at The Pines he begins to
recall those golden hours when the poets used to hold converse,
the soul of Rossetti seems to come back from the land of shadows,
as his friend depicts his winsome ways, his nobility of heart,
his generous interest in the work of others, that lovableness of
nature and charm of personality which, if we are to believe Mr.
Ford Madox Hueffer, worked, in some degree, ill for the
poet.&nbsp; Mr. Hueffer, who, as a family connection, may be
supposed to represent the family tradition about
&lsquo;Gabriel,&rsquo; has some striking and pregnant words upon
the injurious effect of Rossetti&rsquo;s being brought so much
into contact with admirers from the time when Mr. Meredith and
Mr. Swinburne were his housemates at Cheyne Walk.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then came the &lsquo;Pre-Raphaelite&rsquo; poets like
Philip <a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>Marston, O&rsquo;Shaughnessy, and &lsquo;B.
V.&rsquo;&nbsp; Afterwards there came a whole host of young men
like Mr. William Sharp, who were serious admirers, and to-day are
in their places or are dead or forgotten; and others again who
came for the &lsquo;pickings.&rsquo;&nbsp; They were all more or
less enthusiasts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Hake, in &lsquo;Notes and Queries&rsquo; (June 7, 1902),
says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;With regard to the green room in which
Winifred took her first breakfast at &lsquo;Hurstcote,&rsquo; I
am a little in confusion.&nbsp; It seems to me more like the
green dining-room in Cheyne Walk, decorated with antique mirrors,
which was painted by Dunn, showing Rossetti reading his poems
aloud.&nbsp; This is the only portrait of Rossetti that really
calls up the man before me.&nbsp; As Mr. Watts-Dunton is the
owner of Dunn&rsquo;s drawing, and as so many people want to see
what Rossetti&rsquo;s famous Chelsea house was like inside, it is
a pity he does not give it as a frontispiece to some future
edition of &lsquo;Aylwin.&rsquo;&nbsp; Unfortunately, Mr. G. F.
Watts&rsquo;s picture, now in the National Portrait Gallery, was
never finished, and I never saw upon Rossetti&rsquo;s face the
dull, heavy expression which that portrait wears.&nbsp; I think
the poet told me that he had given the painter only one or two
sittings.&nbsp; As to the photographs, none of them is really
satisfactory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I am fortunate in being able to reproduce here the picture of
the famous &lsquo;Green Dining Room&rsquo; at 16 Cheyne Walk, to
which Mr. Hake refers.&nbsp; Mr. Hake also writes in the same
article: &ldquo;With regard to the two circular mirrors
surrounded by painted designs telling the story of the Holy
Grail, &lsquo;in old black oak frames carved with knights at
tilt,&rsquo; I do not remember seeing these there.&nbsp; But they
are evidently the mirrors <a name="page162"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>decorated with copies by Dunn of the
lost Holy Grail frescoes once existing on the walls of the Union
Reading-Room at Oxford.&nbsp; These beautiful decorations I have
seen at &lsquo;The Pines,&rsquo; but not elsewhere.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I am sure that my readers will be interested in the photograph of
one of these famous mirrors, which Mr. Watts-Dunton has
generously permitted to be specially taken for this book.</p>

<p>And here again I must draw upon Dr. Gordon Hake&rsquo;s
fascinating book of poetry, &lsquo;The New Day,&rsquo; which must
live, if only for its reminiscences of the life poetic lived at
Chelsea, Kelmscott, and Bognor:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">THE NEW DAY</p>
<p style="text-align: center">I</p>
<p>In the unbroken silence of the mind<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thoughts creep about us, seeming not to move,<br />
And life is back among the days behind&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The spectral days of that lamented love&mdash;<br />
Days whose romance can never be repeated.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sun of Kelmscott through the foliage
gleaming,<br />
We see him, life-like, at his easel seated,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His voice, his brush, with rival wonders teeming.<br
/>
These vanished hours, where are they stored away?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hear we the voice, or but its lingering tone?<br />
Its utterances are swallowed up in day;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The gabled house, the mighty master gone.<br />
Yet are they ours: the stranger at the hall&mdash;<br />
What dreams he of the days we there recall?</p>
<p style="text-align: center">II</p>
<p>O, happy days with him who once so loved us!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We loved as brothers, with a single heart,<br />
The man whose iris-woven pictures moved us<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From Nature to her blazoned shadow&mdash;Art.<br />
How often did we trace the nestling Thames<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From humblest waters on his course of might,<br />
<a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>Down
where the weir the bursting current stems&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There sat till evening grew to balmy night,<br />
Veiling the weir whose roar recalled the strand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where we had listened to the wave-lipped sea,<br />
That seemed to utter plaudits while we planned<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Triumphal labours of the day to be.<br />
The words were his: &lsquo;Such love can never die;&rsquo;<br />
The grief was ours when he no more was nigh.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">III</p>
<p>Like some sweet water-bell, the tinkling rill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Still calls the flowers upon its misty bank<br />
To stoop into the stream and drink their fill.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And still the shapeless rushes, green and rank,<br
/>
Seem lounging in their pride round those retreats,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Watching slim willows dip their thirsty spray.<br />
Slowly a loosened weed another meets;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They stop, like strangers, neither giving way.<br />
We are here surely if the world, forgot,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Glides from our sight into the charm, unbidden;<br
/>
We are here surely at this witching spot,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though Nature in the reverie is hidden.<br />
A spell so holds our captive eyes in thrall,<br />
It is as if a play pervaded all.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">IV</p>
<p>Sitting with him, his tones as Petrarch&rsquo;s tender,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With many a speaking vision on the wall,<br />
The fire, a-blaze, flashing the studio fender,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Closed in from London shouts and ceaseless
brawl&mdash;<br />
&rsquo;Twas you brought Nature to the visiting,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till she herself seemed breathing in the room,<br />
And Art grew fragrant in the glow of spring<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With homely scents of gorse and heather bloom.<br />
Or sunbeams shone by many an Alpine fountain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fed by the waters of the forest stream;<br />
Or glacier-glories in the rock-girt mountain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where they so often fed the poet&rsquo;s dream;<br
/>
Or else was mingled the rough billow&rsquo;s glee<br />
With cries of petrels on a sullen sea.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a name="page164"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 164</span>V</p>
<p>Remember how we roamed the Channel&rsquo;s shore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And read aloud our verses, each in turn,<br />
While rhythmic waves to us their music bore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And foam-flakes leapt from out the rocky churn.<br
/>
Then oft with glowing eyes you strove to capture<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The potent word that makes a thought abiding,<br />
And wings it upward to its place of rapture,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While we discoursed to Nature, she presiding.<br />
Then would the poet-painter gaze in wonder<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That art knew not the mighty reverie<br />
That moves earth&rsquo;s spirit and her orb asunder,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While ocean&rsquo;s depths, even, seem a shallow
sea.<br />
Yet with rare genius could his hand impart<br />
His own far-searching poesy to art.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fourth of these exquisite sonnets delights me most of
all.&nbsp; It makes me see the recluse in his studio, sitting
snugly with his feet in the fender, when suddenly the door opens
and the poet of Nature brings with him a new atmosphere&mdash;the
salt atmosphere which envelops &lsquo;Mother Carey&rsquo;s
Chicken,&rsquo; and the attenuated mountain air of Natura
Benigna.&nbsp; And yet perhaps the description of</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The sun of Kelmscott through the foliage
gleaming&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is equally fascinating.</p>
<p>Mr. Watts-Dunton himself, with a stronger hand and more
vigorous brush, has in his sonnet &lsquo;The Shadow on the Window
Blind,&rsquo; made Kelmscott Manor and the poetic life lived
there still more memorable:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Within this thicket&rsquo;s every leafy lair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A song-bird sleeps: the very rooks are dumb,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though red behind their nests the moon has
swum&mdash;<br />
But still I see that shadow writing there!&mdash;<br />
Poet, behind yon casement&rsquo;s ruddy square,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>Whose shadow tells me why you do not come&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rhyming and chiming of thine insect-hum,<br />
Flying and singing through thine inch of air&mdash;</p>
<p>Come thither, where on grass and flower and leaf<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Gleams Nature&rsquo;s scripture, putting Man&rsquo;s
to shame:<br />
&lsquo;Thy day,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;is all too rich and
brief&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy game of life too wonderful a game&mdash;<br />
To give to Art entirely or in chief:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Drink of these dews&mdash;sweeter than wine of
Fame.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Aylwin,&rsquo; too, is full of vivid pictures of
Rossetti at Chelsea and Kelmscott.</p>
<p>The following description of the famous house and garden, 16
Cheyne Walk, has been declared by one of Rossetti&rsquo;s most
intimate friends to be marvellously graphic and true:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;On sending in my card I was shown at once
into the studio, and after threading my way between some pieces
of massive furniture and pictures upon easels, I found
D&rsquo;Arcy lolling lazily upon a huge sofa.&nbsp; Seeing that
he was not alone, I was about to withdraw, for I was in no mood
to meet strangers.&nbsp; However, he sprang up and introduced me
to his guest, whom he called Symonds, an elegant-looking man in a
peculiar kind of evening dress, who, as I afterwards learnt, was
one of Mr. D&rsquo;Arcy&rsquo;s chief buyers.&nbsp; This
gentleman bowed stiffly to me.</p>
<p>He did not stay long; indeed, it was evident that the
appearance of a stranger somewhat disconcerted him.</p>
<p>After he was gone D&rsquo;Arcy said: &lsquo;A good
fellow!&nbsp; One of my most important buyers.&nbsp; I should
like you to know him, for you and I are going to be friends, I
hope.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He seems very fond of pictures,&rsquo; I said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A man of great taste, with a real love of art and
music.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>A
little while after this gentleman&rsquo;s departure, in came De
Castro, who had driven up in a hansom.&nbsp; I certainly saw a
flash of anger in his eyes as he recognized me, but it vanished
like lightning, and his manner became cordiality itself.&nbsp;
Late as it was (it was nearly twelve), he pulled out his
cigarette case, and evidently intended to begin the
evening.&nbsp; As soon as he was told that Mr. Symonds had been
there, he began to talk about him in a disparaging manner.&nbsp;
Evidently his m&eacute;tier was, as I had surmised, that of a
professional talker.&nbsp; Talk was his stock-in-trade.</p>
<p>The night wore on and De Castro, in the intervals of his talk,
kept pulling out his watch.&nbsp; It was evident that he wanted
to be going, but was reluctant to leave me there.&nbsp; For my
part, I frequently rose to go, but on getting a sign from
D&rsquo;Arcy that he wished me to stay I sat down again.&nbsp; At
last D&rsquo;Arcy said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;You had better go now, De Castro&mdash;you have kept
that hansom outside for more than an hour and a half; and
besides, if you stay still daylight our friend here will stay
longer, for I want to talk with him alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>De Castro got up with a laugh that seemed genuine enough, and
left us.</p>
<p>D&rsquo;Arcy, who was still on the sofa, then lapsed into a
silence that became after a while rather awkward.&nbsp; He lay
there, gazing abstractedly at the fireplace.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some of my friends call me, as you heard De Castro say
the other night, Haroun-al-Raschid, and I suppose I am like him
in some things.&nbsp; I am a bad sleeper, and to be amused by De
Castro when I can&rsquo;t sleep is the chief of blessings.&nbsp;
De Castro, however, is not so bad as he seems.&nbsp; A man may be
a scandal-monger without being really malignant.&nbsp; I have
known him go out of his way to do a struggling man a
service.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>Next
morning, after I had finished my solitary breakfast, I asked the
servant if Mr. D&rsquo;Arcy had yet risen.&nbsp; On being told
that he had not, I went downstairs into the studio, where I had
spent the previous evening.&nbsp; After examining the pictures on
the walls and the easels, I walked to the window and looked out
at the garden.&nbsp; It was large, and so neglected and untrimmed
as to be a veritable wilderness.&nbsp; While I was marvelling why
it should have been left in this state, I saw the eyes of some
animal staring at me from a distance, and was soon astonished to
see that they belonged to a little Indian bull.&nbsp; My
curiosity induced me to go into the garden and look at the
creature.&nbsp; He seemed rather threatening at first, but after
a while allowed me to go up to him and stroke him.&nbsp; Then I
left the Indian bull and explored this extraordinary
domain.&nbsp; It was full of unkempt trees, including two fine
mulberries, and surrounded by a very high wall.&nbsp; Soon I came
across an object which, at first, seemed a little mass of black
and white oats moving along, but I presently discovered it to be
a hedgehog.&nbsp; It was so tame that it did not curl up as I
approached it, but allowed me, though with some show of
nervousness, to stroke its pretty little black snout.&nbsp; As I
walked about the garden, I found it was populated with several
kinds of animals such as are never seen except in menageries or
in the Zoological Gardens.&nbsp; Wombats, kangaroos, and the
like, formed a kind of happy family.</p>
<p>My love of animals led me to linger in the garden.&nbsp; When
I returned to the house I found that D&rsquo;Arcy had already
breakfasted, and was at work in the studio.</p>
<p>After greeting me with the greatest cordiality, he said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;No doubt you are surprised at my menagerie.&nbsp; <a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>Every man
has one side of his character where the child remains.&nbsp; I
have a love of animals which, I suppose, I may call a
passion.&nbsp; The kind of amusement they can afford me is like
none other.&nbsp; It is the self-consciousness of men and women
that makes them, in a general way, intensely unamusing.&nbsp; I
turn from them to the unconscious brutes, and often get a world
of enjoyment.&nbsp; To watch a kitten or a puppy play, or the
funny antics of a parrot or a cockatoo, or the wise movements of
a wombat, will keep me for hours from being bored.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And children,&rsquo; I said&mdash;&lsquo;do you like
children?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, so long as they remain like the young
animals&mdash;until they become self-conscious, I mean, and that
is very soon.&nbsp; Then their charm goes.&nbsp; Has it ever
occurred to you how fascinating a beautiful young girl would be
if she were as unconscious as a young animal?&nbsp; What makes
you sigh?&rsquo;</p>
<p>My thoughts had flown to Winifred breakfasting with her
&lsquo;Prince of the Mist&rsquo; on Snowdon.&nbsp; And I said to
myself, &lsquo;How he would have been fascinated by a sight like
that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>My experience of men at that time was so slight that the
opinion I then formed of D&rsquo;Arcy as a talker was not of much
account.&nbsp; But since then I have seen very much of men, and I
find that I was right in the view I then took of his
conversational powers.&nbsp; When his spirits were at their
highest he was without an equal as a wit, without an equal as a
humourist.&nbsp; He had more than even Cyril Aylwin&rsquo;s
quickness of repartee, and it was of an incomparably rarer
quality.&nbsp; To define it would be, of course, impossible, but
I might perhaps call it poetic fancy suddenly stimulated at
moments by animal spirits into rapid movements&mdash;so rapid,
indeed, that what in slower movement would be merely fancy, in
him became wit.&nbsp; <a name="page169"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 169</span>Beneath the coruscations of this wit
a rare and deep intellect was always perceptible.</p>
<p>His humour was also so fanciful that it seemed poetry at play,
but here was the remarkable thing: although he was not
unconscious of his other gifts, he did not seem to be in the
least aware that he was a humourist of the first order; every
&lsquo;jeu d&rsquo;esprit&rsquo; seemed to leap from him
involuntarily, like the spray from a fountain.&nbsp; A dull man
like myself must not attempt to reproduce these qualities
here.</p>
<p>While he was talking he kept on painting.&rdquo;</p>

WILLIAM MORRIS</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is natural after writing about
Rossetti to think of William Morris.&nbsp; In my opinion the
masterpiece among all Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; monographs is the one upon
him.&nbsp; Between these two there was an intimacy of the closest
kind&mdash;from 1873 to the day of the poet&rsquo;s death.&nbsp;
This, no doubt, apart from Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s graphic
power, accounts for the extraordinary vividness of the portrait
of his friend.&nbsp; I have heard more than one eminent friend of
William Morris say that from a few paragraphs of this monograph a
reader gains a far more vivid picture of this fascinating man
than is to be gained from reading and re-reading anything else
that has been published about him.&nbsp; It is a grievous loss to
literature that the man so fully equipped for writing a biography
of Morris is scarcely likely to write one.&nbsp; Morris, when he
was busy in Queen&rsquo;s Square, used to be one of the most
frequent visitors at the gatherings at Danes Inn with Mr.
Swinburne, Dr. Westland Marston, Madox Brown, and others, on
Wednesday evenings; and he and Mr. Watts-Dunton were frequently
together at Kelmscott during the time of the joint occupancy of
the old Manor house, and also after Rossetti&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>When Mr. Watts-Dunton wrote &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; he did not
contemplate that the Hurstcote of the story would immediately be
identified with Kelmscott Manor.&nbsp; The <a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>pictures of
localities and the descriptions of the characters were so vivid
that Hurstcote was at once identified with Kelmscott, and
D&rsquo;Arcy was at once identified with Rossetti.&nbsp;
Morris&rsquo;s passion for angling is slightly introduced in the
later chapters of the book, and this is not surprising, for some
of the happiest moments of Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s life were
spent at Kelmscott.&nbsp; Treffry Dunn&rsquo;s portrait of him,
sitting on a fallen tree beside the back-water, was painted at
Kelmscott, and the scenery and the house are admirably rendered
in the picture.</p>
<p>Mr. Hake, in &lsquo;Notes and Queries&rsquo; (June 7, 1902)
mentions some interesting facts with regard to &lsquo;Hurstcote
Manor&rsquo; and Morris:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Morris, whom I had the privilege of knowing
very well, and with whom I have stayed at Kelmscott during the
Rossetti period, is alluded to in &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; (chap. lx.
book xv.) as the &lsquo;enthusiastic angler&rsquo; who used to go
down to &lsquo;Hurstcote&rsquo; to fish.&nbsp; At that time this
fine old seventeenth century manor house was in the joint
occupancy of Rossetti and Morris.&nbsp; Afterwards it was in the
joint occupancy of Morris and (a beloved friend of the two) the
late F. S. Ellis, who, with Mr. Cockerell, was executor under
Morris&rsquo;s will.&nbsp; The series of &lsquo;large attics in
which was a number of enormous oak beams&rsquo; supporting the
antique roof, was a favourite resort of my own; but all the
ghostly noise that I there heard was the snoring of young
owls&mdash;a peculiar sound that had a special fascination for
Rossetti; and after dinner Rossetti, my brother, and I, or Mr.
Watts-Dunton and I, would go to the attics to listen to them.</p>
<p>With regard to &lsquo;Hurstcote&rsquo; I well knew &lsquo;the
large bedroom, with low-panelled walls and the vast antique <a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>bedstead
made of black carved oak&rsquo; upon which Winifred Wynne
slept.&nbsp; In fact, the only thing in the description of this
room that I do not remember is the beautiful &lsquo;Madonna and
Child,&rsquo; upon the frame of which was written &lsquo;Chiaro
dell&rsquo; Erma&rsquo; (readers of &lsquo;Hand and Soul&rsquo;
will remember that name).&nbsp; I wonder whether it is a Madonna
by Parmigiano, belonging to Mr. Watts-Dunton, which was much
admired by Leighton and others, and which has been
exhibited.&nbsp; This quaint and picturesque bedroom leads by two
or three steps to the tapestried room &lsquo;covered with old
faded tapestry&mdash;so faded, indeed, that its general effect
was that of a dull grey texture&rsquo;&mdash;depicting the story
of Samson.&nbsp; Rossetti used the tapestry room as a studio, and
I have seen in it the very same pictures that so attracted the
attention of Winifred Wynne: the &lsquo;grand brunette&rsquo;
(painted from Mrs. Morris) &lsquo;holding a pomegranate in her
hand&rsquo;; the &lsquo;other brunette, whose beautiful eyes are
glistening and laughing over the fruit she is holding up&rsquo;
(painted from the same famous Irish beauty, named Smith, who
appears in &lsquo;The Beloved&rsquo;), and the blonde
&lsquo;under the apple blossoms&rsquo; (painted from a still more
beautiful woman&mdash;Mrs. Stillman).&nbsp; These pictures were
not permanently placed there, but, as it chanced, they were there
(for retouching) on a certain occasion when I was visiting at
Kelmscott.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Among the remarkable men that Mr. Watts-Dunton used to meet at
Kelmscott, was Morris&rsquo;s friend, Dr. John Henry Middleton,
Slade Professor of Fine Art in the University of Cambridge and
Art Director of the South Kensington Museum&mdash;a man of
extraordinary gifts, who promised to be one of the foremost of
the scholarly writers of our time, but who died
prematurely.&nbsp; <a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>Some of Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s anecdotes of the
causeries at Kelmscott between Morris, Middleton, and himself,
are so interesting that it is a pity they have never been
recorded in print.&nbsp; Middleton was one of Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s collaborators in the ninth edition of the
&lsquo;Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica,&rsquo; to which he
contributed the article on &lsquo;Rome,&rsquo; one of the finest
essays in that work.</p>
<p>Morris was notoriously indifferent to critical expressions
about his work; and he used to declare that the only reviews of
his works which he ever took the trouble to read were the reviews
by Mr. Watts-Dunton in the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And the poet, might well say this, for those who have studied, as
I have, those elaborate and brilliant essays upon
&lsquo;Sigurd,&rsquo; &lsquo;The House of the Wolfings,&rsquo;
&lsquo;The Roots of the Mountains,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Glittering
Plain,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Well at the World&rsquo;s End,&rsquo;
&lsquo;The Tale of Beowulf,&rsquo; &lsquo;News from
Nowhere,&rsquo; &lsquo;Poems by the Way,&rsquo; will be inclined
to put them at the top of all Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s purely
critical work.&nbsp; The &lsquo;Quarterly Review,&rsquo; in the
article upon Morris, makes allusion to the relations between Mr.
Watts-Dunton and Morris; so does the writer of the admirable
article upon Morris in the new edition of Chambers&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Cyclop&aelig;dia of English Literature.&rsquo;&nbsp; I
record these facts, not in order to depreciate the work of other
men, but as a justification for the extracts I am going to make
from Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s monograph in the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The article contains these beautiful meditations on Pain and
Death:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Each time that I saw him he declared, in
answer to my inquiries, that he suffered no pain whatever.&nbsp;
And a comforting thought this is to us all&mdash;that Morris
suffered no pain.&nbsp; To Death himself we may easily be
reconciled&mdash;<a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>nay, we might even look upon him as Nature&rsquo;s
final beneficence to all her children, if it were not for the
cruel means he so often employs in fulfilling his inevitable
mission.&nbsp; The thought that Morris&rsquo;s life had ended in
the tragedy of pain&mdash;the thought that he to whom work was
sport, and generosity the highest form of enjoyment, suffered
what some men suffer in shuffling off the mortal coil&mdash;would
have been intolerable almost.&nbsp; For among the thousand and
one charms of the man, this, perhaps, was the chief, that Nature
had endowed him with an enormous capacity of enjoyment, and that
Circumstance, conspiring with Nature, said to him,
&lsquo;Enjoy.&rsquo;&nbsp; Born in easy circumstances, though not
to the degrading trouble of wealth&mdash;cherishing as his
sweetest possessions a devoted wife and two daughters, each of
them endowed with intelligence so rare as to understand a genius
such as his&mdash;surrounded by friends, some of whom were among
the first men of our time, and most of whom were of the very salt
of the earth&mdash;it may be said of him that Misfortune, if she
touched him at all, never struck home.&nbsp; If it is true, as
M&eacute;rim&eacute;e affirms, that men are hastened to maturity
by misfortune, who wanted Morris to be mature?&nbsp; Who wanted
him to be other than the radiant boy of genius that he remained
till the years had silvered his hair and carved wrinkles on his
brow, but left his blue-grey eyes as bright as when they first
opened on the world?&nbsp; Enough for us to think that the man
must, indeed, be specially beloved by the gods who in his
sixty-third year dies young.&nbsp; Old age Morris could not have
borne with patience.&nbsp; Pain would not have developed him into
a hero.&nbsp; This beloved man, who must have died some day, died
when his marvellous powers were at their best&mdash;and died
without pain.&nbsp; The scheme of life and death does not seem so
much awry, after all.</p>
<p><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>At
the last interview but one that ever I had with him&mdash;it was
in the little carpetless room from which so much of his best work
was turned out&mdash;he himself surprised me by leading the
conversation upon a subject he rarely chose to talk
about&mdash;the mystery of life and death.&nbsp; The conversation
ended with these words of his: &lsquo;I have enjoyed my
life&mdash;few men more so&mdash;and death in any case is
sure.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is in this same vivid word-picture that occur Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s reflections upon the wear and tear of
genius:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is difficult not to think that the cause
of causes of his death was excessive exercise of all his forces,
especially of the imaginative faculty.&nbsp; When I talked to
him, as I often did, of the peril of such a life of tension as
his, he pooh-poohed the idea.&nbsp; &lsquo;Look at
Gladstone,&rsquo; he would say, &lsquo;look at those wise owls
your chancellors and your judges.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t they live all
the longer for work?&nbsp; It is rust that kills men, not
work.&rsquo;&nbsp; No doubt he was right in contending that in
intellectual efforts such as those he alluded to, where the only
faculty drawn upon is the &lsquo;dry light of
intelligence,&rsquo; a prodigious amount of work may be achieved
without any sapping of the sources of life.&nbsp; But is this so
where that fusion of all the faculties which we call genius is
greatly taxed?&nbsp; I doubt it.&nbsp; In all true imaginative
production there is, as De Quincey pointed out many years ago, a
movement, not of &lsquo;the thinking machine&rsquo; only, but of
the whole man&mdash;the whole &lsquo;genial&rsquo; nature of the
worker&mdash;his imagination, his judgment, moving in an
evolution of lightning velocity from the whole of the work to the
part, from the part to the whole, together with every emotion of
the soul.&nbsp; Hence when, as in the case of Walter Scott, of <a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>Charles
Dickens, and presumably of Shakespeare too, the emotional nature
of Man is overtaxed, every part of the frame suffers, and cries
out in vain for its share of that nervous fluid which is the true
vis vit&aelig;.</p>
<p>We have only to consider the sort of work Morris produced, and
its amount, to realize that no human powers could continue to
withstand such a strain.&nbsp; Many are of opinion that
&lsquo;The Lovers of Gudrun&rsquo; is his finest poem; he worked
at it from four o&rsquo;clock in the morning till four in the
afternoon, and when he rose from the table he had produced 750
lines!&nbsp; Think of the forces at work in producing a poem like
&lsquo;Sigurd.&rsquo;&nbsp; Think of the mingling of the drudgery
of the Dryasdust with the movements of an imaginative vision
unsurpassed in our time; think, I say, of the collating of the
&lsquo;Volsunga Saga&rsquo; with the
&lsquo;Nibelungenlied,&rsquo; the choosing of this point from the
Saga-man, and of that point from the later poem of the Germans,
and then fusing the whole by imaginative heat into the greatest
epic of the nineteenth century.&nbsp; Was there not work enough
here for a considerable portion of a poet&rsquo;s life?&nbsp; And
yet so great is the entire mass of his work that
&lsquo;Sigurd&rsquo; is positively overlooked in many of the
notices of his writings which have appeared in the last few days
in the press, while in the others it is alluded to in three
words; and this simply because the mass of other matter to be
dealt with fills up all the available space of a
newspaper.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s critical acumen is nowhere more
strikingly seen than in his remarks upon Morris&rsquo;s
translation of the Odyssey:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Some competent critics are dissatisfied
with Morris&rsquo;s translation; yet in a certain sense it is a
triumph.&nbsp; The two specially Homeric qualities&mdash;those,
indeed, which <a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>set Homer apart from all other poets&mdash;are
eagerness and dignity.&nbsp; Never again can they be fully
combined, for never again will poetry be written in the Greek
hexameters and by a Homer.&nbsp; That Tennyson could have given
us the Homeric dignity his magnificent rendering of a famous
fragment of the Iliad shows.&nbsp; Chapman&rsquo;s translations
show that the eagerness also can be caught.&nbsp; Morris, of
course, could not have given the dignity of Homer, but then,
while Tennyson has left us only a few lines speaking with the
dignity of the Iliad, Morris gave us a translation of the entire
Odyssey, which, though it missed the Homeric dignity, secured the
eagerness as completely as Chapman&rsquo;s free-and-easy
paraphrase, and in a rendering as literal as Buckley&rsquo;s
prose crib, which lay frankly by Morris&rsquo;s side as he wrote.
. . .&nbsp; Morris&rsquo;s translation of the Odyssey and his
translation of Virgil, where he gives us an almost word-for-word
translation and yet throws over the poem a glamour of romance
which brings Virgil into the sympathy of the modern reader, would
have occupied years with almost any other poet.&nbsp; But these
two efforts of his genius are swamped by the purely original
poems, such as &lsquo;The Defence of Guenevere,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Jason,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Earthly Paradise,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Love is Enough,&rsquo; &lsquo;Poems by the Way,&rsquo;
etc.&nbsp; And then come his translations from the
Icelandic.&nbsp; Mere translation is, of course, easy enough, but
not such translation as that in the &lsquo;Saga
Library.&rsquo;&nbsp; Allowing for all the aid he got from Mr.
Magnusson, what a work this is!&nbsp; Think of the imaginative
exercise required to turn the language of these Saga-men into a
diction so picturesque and so concrete as to make each Saga an
English poem&mdash;for poem each one is, if Aristotle is right in
thinking that imaginative substance and not metre is the first
requisite of a poem.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>In
connection with William Morris, readers of &lsquo;The Coming of
Love&rsquo; will recall the touching words in the
&lsquo;Prefatory Note&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Had it not been for the intervention of
matters of a peculiarly absorbing kind&mdash;matters which caused
me to delay the task of collecting these verses&mdash;I should
have been the most favoured man who ever brought out a volume of
poems, for they would have been printed by William Morris, at the
Kelmscott Press.&nbsp; As that projected edition of his was
largely subscribed for, a word of explanation to the subscribers
is, I am told, required from me.&nbsp; Among the friends who saw
much of that great poet and beloved man during the last year of
his life, there was one who would not and could not believe that
he would die&mdash;myself.&nbsp; To me he seemed human vitality
concentrated to a point of quenchless light; and when the
appalling truth that he must die did at last strike through me, I
had no heart and no patience to think about anything in
connection with him but the loss that was to come upon us.&nbsp;
And, now, whatsoever pleasure I may feel at seeing my verses in
one of Mr. Lane&rsquo;s inviting little volumes will be dimmed
and marred by the thought that Morris&rsquo;s name also might
have been, and is not, on the imprint.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a matter of fact this incident in the publication of
&lsquo;The Coming of Love&rsquo; is an instance of that artistic
conscientiousness which up to a certain point is of inestimable
value to the poet, but after that point is reached, baffles
him.&nbsp; The poem had been read in fragments and deeply admired
by that galaxy of poets among whom Mr. Watts-Dunton moved.&nbsp;
Certain fragments of it had appeared in the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; and other journals, but <a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>the
publication of the entire poem had been delayed owing to the fact
that certain portions of it had been lent and lost.&nbsp; Morris
not only offered to bring out at the Kelmscott Press an
&eacute;dition de luxe of the book, but he actually took the
trouble to get a full list of subscribers, and insisted upon
allowing the author a magnificent royalty.&nbsp; Nothing,
however, would persuade Mr. Watts-Dunton to bring out the book
until these lost portions could be found, and notwithstanding the
generous urgings of Morris, the matter stood still; and then,
when the book was ready, Morris was seized by that illness which
robbed us of one of the greatest writers of the nineteenth
century.&nbsp; And even after Morris&rsquo;s death the
poet&rsquo;s executors and friends, the late Mr. F. S. Ellis and
the well-known bibliographer, Mr. Sydney C. Cockerell, were
willing and even desirous that the Kelmscott edition of the poems
should be brought out.&nbsp; Subsequently, when a large portion
of the lost poems was found, the volume was published by Mr. John
Lane.&nbsp; This anecdote alone explains why Mr. Watts-Dunton is
never tired of dwelling upon the nobility of Morris&rsquo;s
nature, and upon his generosity in small things as well as in
large.</p>
<p>Another favourite story of his in connection with this subject
is the following.&nbsp; When Morris published his first volume in
the Kelmscott Press, he sent Mr. Watts-Dunton a presentation copy
of the book.&nbsp; He also sent him a presentation copy of the
second and third.&nbsp; But knowing how small was the profit at
this time from the books issued by the Kelmscott Press, Mr.
Watts-Dunton felt a little delicacy in taking these presentation
copies, and told Mrs. Morris that she should gently protest
against such extravagance.&nbsp; Mrs. Morris assured him that it
would be perfectly useless to do so.&nbsp; <a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>But when
the edition of Keats was coming out, Mr. Watts-Dunton determined
to grapple with the matter, and one Sunday afternoon when he was
at Kelmscott House, he said to Morris:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Morris, I wish you to put my name down as a subscriber
to the Keats, and I give my commission for it in the presence of
witnesses.&nbsp; I am a paying subscriber to the
Keats.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right, old chap, you&rsquo;re a
subscriber.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In spite of this there came the usual presentation copy of the
Keats; and when Mr. Watts-Dunton was at Kelmscott House on the
following Sunday afternoon, he told Morris that a mistake had
been made.&nbsp; Morris laughed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right, there&rsquo;s no mistake&mdash;that is my
presentation copy of Keats.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But when at last the magnum opus of the Kelmscott Press was
being discussed&mdash;the marvellous Chaucer with
Burne-Jones&rsquo;s illustrations&mdash;Mr. Watts-Dunton knew
that here a great deal of money was to be risked, and probably
sunk, and he said to Morris:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Morris, I&rsquo;m going to talk to you seriously
about the Chaucer.&nbsp; I know that it&rsquo;s going to be a
dead loss to you, and I do really and seriously hope that you do
not contemplate anything so wild as to send me a presentation
copy of that book.&nbsp; You know my affection for you, and you
know I speak the truth, when I tell you that it would give me
pain to accept it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, old chap, very likely this time I shall have to
stay my hand, for, between ourselves, I expect I shall drop some
money over it; but the Chaucer will be at The Pines, because Ned
Jones and I are going to join in the presentation of a copy to
Algernon Swinburne.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After this Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s mind was set at rest, as
he told Mrs. Morris.&nbsp; But when Mr. Swinburne&rsquo;s <a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>copy
reached &lsquo;The Pines&rsquo; it was accompanied by another
one&mdash;&lsquo;Theodore Watts-Dunton from William
Morris.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Another anecdote, illustrative of his generosity, Mr.
Watts-Dunton also tells.&nbsp; Mr. Swinburne, wishing to possess
a copy of &lsquo;The Golden Legend,&rsquo; bought the Kelmscott
edition, and one day Mr. Watts-Dunton told Morris this.&nbsp;
Morris gave a start as though a sudden pain had struck him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What!&nbsp; Algernon pay ten pounds for a book of
mine!&nbsp; Why I thought he did not care for black letter
reproductions, or I would have sent him a copy of every book I
brought out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And when he did bring out another book, two copies were sent
to &lsquo;The Pines,&rsquo; one for Mr. Watts-Dunton and one for
Mr. Swinburne.</p>
<p>Mr. Watts-Dunton, speaking about &lsquo;The Water of the
Wondrous Isles,&rsquo; tells this amusing story:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Once, many years ago, Morris was inveigled
into seeing and hearing the great poet-singer Stead, whose
rhythms have had such a great effect upon the &lsquo;art
poetic,&rsquo; the author of &lsquo;The Perfect Cure,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s Daddy this and Daddy that,&rsquo; and other
brilliant lyrics.&nbsp; A friend with whom Morris had been
spending the evening, and who had been talking about poetic
energy and poetic art in relation to the chilly reception
accorded to &lsquo;Sigurd,&rsquo; persuaded him&mdash;much
against his will&mdash;to turn in for a few seconds to see Mr.
Stead, whose performance consisted of singing a song, the burden
of which was &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a perfect cure!&rsquo; while he
leaped up into the air without bending his legs and twirled round
like a dervish.&nbsp; &lsquo;What made you bring me to see this
damned tomfoolery?&rsquo; Morris grumbled; and on being told that
it <a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>was
to give him an example of poetic energy at its tensest, without
poetic art, he grumbled still more and shouldered his way
out.&nbsp; If Morris were now alive&mdash;and all England will
sigh, &lsquo;Ah, would he were!&rsquo;&mdash;he would confess,
with his customary emphasis, that the poet had nothing of the
slightest importance to learn, even from the rhythms of Mr.
Stead, marked as they were by terpsichorean pauses that were
beyond the powers of the &lsquo;Great Vance.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

183</span>Chapter XIII<br />
THE &lsquo;EXAMINER&rsquo;</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Long</span> before Mr. Watts-Dunton
printed a line, he was a prominent figure in the literary and
artistic sets in London; but, as Mr. Hake has said, it was merely
as a conversationalist that he was known.&nbsp; His conversation
was described by Rossetti as being like that of no other person
moving in literary circles, because he was always enunciating new
views in phrasings so polished that, to use Rossetti&rsquo;s
words, his improvized locutions were as perfect as &lsquo;fitted
jewels.&rsquo;&nbsp; Those who have been privileged to listen to
his table-talk will attest the felicity of the image.&nbsp;
Seldom has so great a critic had so fine an audience.&nbsp;
Rossetti often lamented that Theodore Watts&rsquo; spoken
criticism had never been taken down in shorthand.&nbsp; For a
long time various editors who had met him at Rossetti&rsquo;s, at
Madox Brown&rsquo;s, at Westland Marston&rsquo;s, at
Whistler&rsquo;s breakfasts, and at the late Lord
Houghton&rsquo;s, endeavoured to persuade him to make practical
use in criticism of the ideas that flowed in a continuous stream
from his lips.&nbsp; But, as Rossetti used to affirm, he was the
one man of his time who, with immense literary equipment, was
without literary ambition.&nbsp; This peculiarity of his was
eloquently described by the late Dr. Gordon Hake in his
&lsquo;New Day&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>You say you care not for the people&rsquo;s
praise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That poetry is its own recompense;<br />
You care not for the wreath, the dusty bays,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Given to the whirling wind and hurried hence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>The
first editor who secured Theodore Watts, after repeated efforts
to do so, was the late Professor Minto, and this only came about
because during his editorship of the &lsquo;Examiner&rsquo; both
he and Watts resided in Danes Inn, and were constantly seeing
each other.</p>
<p>It was Minto who afterwards declared that &ldquo;the articles
in the &lsquo;Examiner&rsquo; and the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; are goldmines, in which we others
are apt to dig unconsciously without remembering that the nuggets
are Theodore Watts&rsquo;s, who is too lazy to peg out his
claim.&rdquo;&nbsp; The first article by him that appeared in
Minto&rsquo;s paper attracted great attention and roused great
curiosity.&nbsp; This indeed is not surprising, for, as I found
when I read it, it was as remarkable for pregnancy of thought and
of style as the latest and ripest of his essays.&nbsp; A friend
of his, belonging to the set in which he moved, who remembers the
appearance of this article, has been kind enough to tell me the
following anecdote in connection with it.&nbsp; The contributors
to the paper at that time consisted of Minto, Dr Garnett,
Swinburne, Edmund Gosse, &lsquo;Scholar&rsquo; Williams, Comyns
Carr, Walter Pollock, Duffield (the translator of &lsquo;Don
Quixote&rsquo;), Professor Sully, Dr. Marston, William Bell
Scott, William Black, and many other able writers.&nbsp; On the
evening of the day when Theodore Watts&rsquo;s first article
appeared, there was a party at the house of William Bell Scott in
Chelsea, and every one was asking who this new contributor
was.&nbsp; It was one of the conditions under which the article
was written that its authorship was to be kept a secret.&nbsp;
Bell Scott, who took a great interest in the
&lsquo;Examiner,&rsquo; was especially inquisitive about the new
writer.&nbsp; After having in vain tried to get from Minto the
name of the writer, he went up to Watts, and said: &ldquo;I would
give almost anything to know who the writer <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>is who
appears in the &lsquo;Examiner&rsquo; for the first time
today.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What makes you inquire about
it?&rdquo; said Watts.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is the interest
attaching to the writer of such fantastic stuff as that?&nbsp;
Surely it is the most mannered writing that has appeared in the
&lsquo;Examiner&rsquo; for a long time!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then,
turning to Minto, he said: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think, Minto,
what made you print it at all.&rdquo;&nbsp; Scott, who had a most
exalted opinion of Watts as a critic, was considerably abashed at
this, and began to endeavour to withdraw some of his enthusiastic
remarks.&nbsp; This set Minto laughing aloud, and thus the secret
got out.</p>
<p>From that hour Watts became the most noticeable writer among a
group of critics who were all noticeable.&nbsp; Week after week
there appeared in this historic paper criticism as fine as had
ever appeared in it in the time of Leigh Hunt, and as brilliant
as had appeared in it in the time of Fonblanque.&nbsp; At this
time Minto used to entertain his contributors on Monday evening
in the room over the publisher&rsquo;s office in the Strand, and
I have been told by one who was frequently there that these
smoking symposia were among the most brilliant in London.&nbsp;
One can well imagine this when one remembers the names of those
who used to attend the meetings.</p>
<p>It was through the &lsquo;Examiner&rsquo; that Watts formed
that friendship with William Black which his biographer, Sir
Wemyss Reid, alludes to.&nbsp; Between these two there was one
subject on which they were especially in sympathy&mdash;their
knowledge and love of nature.&nbsp; At that time Black was
immensely popular.&nbsp; In personal appearance there was, I am
told, a superficial resemblance between the two, and they were
constantly being mistaken for each other; and yet, when they were
side by side, it was evident that the large, dark moustache and
the black eyes were almost the only points of resemblance between
them.</p>
<p><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>It
was at the then famous house in Gower Street of Mr. Justin
McCarthy that Black and Mr. Watts-Dunton first met.&nbsp;
Speaking as an Irishman of a younger but not, I fear, of so
genial a generation, I hear tantalizing accounts of the popular
gatherings at the home of the most charming and the most
distinguished Irishman of letters in the London of that time,
where so many young men of my own country were welcomed as warmly
as though they had not yet to win their spurs.&nbsp; No one
speaks more enthusiastically of the McCarthy family than Mr.
Watts-Dunton, who seems to have been on terms of friendship with
them almost as soon as he settled in London.&nbsp; Mr.
Watts-Dunton was always a lover of McCarthy&rsquo;s novels, but
on his first visit to Gower Street Mr. McCarthy was, as usual,
full of the subject not of his own novels, but of another
man&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He urged his new friend to read &lsquo;Under
the Greenwood Tree,&rsquo; almost forcing him to take the book
away with him, which he did: this was the way in which Mr.
Watts-Dunton became for the first time acquainted with a story
which he always avers is the only book that has ever revived the
rich rustic humour of Shakespeare&rsquo;s early comedies.&nbsp; A
perfect household of loving natures, warm Irish hearts, bright
Irish intellects, cultivated and rare, according to Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s testimony, was that little family in Gower
Street.&nbsp; I think he will pardon me for repeating one quaint
little story about himself and Black in connection with this
first visit to the McCarthys.&nbsp; On entering the room Mr.
Watts-Dunton was much struck with what appeared to be real
musical genius in a bright-eyed little lady who was delighting
the party with her music.&nbsp; This was at the period in his own
life which Mr. Watts-Dunton calls his &lsquo;music-mad
period.&rsquo;&nbsp; And after a time he got <a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>talking
with the lady.&nbsp; He was a little surprised that he was at
once invited by the musical lady to go to a gathering at her
house.&nbsp; But he was as much pleased as surprised to be so
welcomed, and incontinently accepted the invitation.&nbsp; It
never entered his mind that he had been mistaken for another man,
until the other man entered the room and came up to the
lady.&nbsp; She, on her part, began to look in an embarrassed way
from one to the other of the two swarthy, black-moustached
gentlemen.&nbsp; She had mistaken Mr. Watts-Dunton for William
Black, with whom her acquaintance was but slight.&nbsp; The
contretemps caused much amusement when the husband of the lady,
an eminent novelist, who knew Mr. Watts-Dunton well, introduced
him to his wife.&nbsp; I do not know what was the end of the
comedy, but no doubt it was a satisfactory one.&nbsp; It could
not be otherwise among such people as Justin McCarthy would be
likely to gather round him.</p>
<p>At that time, to quote the words of the same friend of Mr.
Watts-Dunton, Watts used frequently to meet at Bell Scott&rsquo;s
and Rossetti&rsquo;s Professor Appleton, the editor of the
&lsquo;Academy.&rsquo;&nbsp; The points upon which these two
touched were as unlike the points upon which Watts and William
Black touched as could possibly be.&nbsp; They were both students
of Hegel; and when they met, Appleton, who had Hegel on the
brain, invariably drew Watts aside for a long private talk.&nbsp;
People used to leave them alone, on account of the remoteness of
the subject that attracted the two.&nbsp; Watts had now made up
his mind that he would devote himself to literature, and, indeed,
his articles in the &lsquo;Examiner&rsquo; showed that he had
only to do so to achieve a great success.&nbsp; Appleton rarely
left Watts without saying, &ldquo;I do wish you would write for
the &lsquo;Academy.&rsquo;&nbsp; I want you to let me send you
all <a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>the
books on the transcendentalists that come to the
&lsquo;Academy,&rsquo; and let me have articles giving the pith
of them at short intervals.&rdquo;&nbsp; This invitation to
furnish the &lsquo;Academy&rsquo; with a couple of columns
condensing the spirit of many books about subjects upon which
only a handful of people in England were competent to write,
seemed to Watts a grotesque request, seeing that he was at this
very time the leading writer on the &lsquo;Examiner,&rsquo; and
was being constantly approached by other editors.&nbsp; It was
consequently the subject of many a joke between Minto, William
Black, Watts, and the others present at the famous
&lsquo;Examiner&rsquo; gatherings.&nbsp; After a while Mr. Norman
MacColl, who was then the editor of the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um,&rsquo; invited Watts to take an important
part in the reviewing for the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um.&rsquo;&nbsp;
At first he told the editor that there were two obstacles to his
accepting the invitation&mdash;one was that the work that he was
invited to do was largely done by his friend Marston, and that,
although he would like to join him, he scarcely saw his way, on
account of the &lsquo;Examiner,&rsquo; which was ready to take
all the work he could produce.&nbsp; On opening the matter to Dr
Marston, that admirably endowed writer would not hear of
Watts&rsquo;s considering him in the matter.&nbsp; The
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; was then, as now, the leading
literary organ in Europe, and the editor&rsquo;s offer was, of
course, a very tempting one, and Watts was determined to tell
Minto about it.&nbsp; And this he did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Minto,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it rests entirely
with you whether I shall write in the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; or not.&rdquo;&nbsp; Minto, between
whom and Watts there was a deep affection, made the following
reply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Theodore, I need not say that it will not be a
good day for the &lsquo;Examiner&rsquo; when you join the <a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
&lsquo;Examiner&rsquo; is a struggling paper which could not live
without being subsidized by Peter Taylor, and it is not four
months ago since Leicester Warren said to me that he and all the
other readers of the &lsquo;Examiner&rsquo; looked eagerly for
the &lsquo;T. W.&rsquo; at the foot of a literary article.&nbsp;
The &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; is both a powerful and a wealthy
paper.&nbsp; In short, it will injure the &lsquo;Examiner&rsquo;
when your name is associated with the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um.&rsquo;&nbsp; But to be the leading voice
of such a paper as that is just what you ought to be, and I
cannot help advising you to entertain MacColl&rsquo;s
proposal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In consequence of this Mr. Watts-Dunton closed with Mr.
MacColl&rsquo;s offer, and his first article in the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; appeared on July 8, 1876.</p>
<h2><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>Chapter XIV<br />
THE &lsquo;ATHEN&AElig;UM&rsquo;</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the first review which Mr.
Watts-Dunton contributed to the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; has
been so often discussed, and as it is as characteristic as any
other of his style, I have determined to reprint it entire.&nbsp;
It has the additional interest, I believe, of being the most
rapidly executed piece of literary work which Mr. Watts-Dunton
ever achieved.&nbsp; Mr. MacColl, having secured the new writer,
tried to find a book for him, and failed, until Mr. Watts-Dunton
asked him whether he intended to give an article upon
Skelton&rsquo;s &lsquo;Comedy of the Noctes
Ambrosian&aelig;.&rsquo;&nbsp; The editor said that he had not
thought of giving the book a considerable article, but that, if
Mr. Watts-Dunton liked to take it, it should be sent to
him.&nbsp; As the article was wanted on the following day, it was
dictated as fast as the amanuensis&mdash;not a shorthand
writer&mdash;could take it down.</p>
<p>It has no relation to the Renascence of Wonder, nor is it one
of his great essays, such as the one on the Psalms, or his essays
on Victor Hugo, but in style it is as characteristic as
any:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Is it really that the great squeezing of
books has at last begun?&nbsp; Here, at least, is the
&lsquo;Noctes Ambrosian&aelig;&rsquo; squeezed into one
volume.</p>
<p>Long ago we came upon an anecdote in Castellan, the subject of
which, as far as we remember, is this.&nbsp; <a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>The library
of the Indian kings was composed of so many volumes that a
thousand camels were necessary to remove it.&nbsp; But once on a
time a certain prince who loved reading much and other pleasures
more, called a Brahmin to him, and said: &lsquo;Books are good, O
Brahmin, even as women are good, yet surely, of both these goods
a prince may have too many; and then, O Brahmin, which of these
two vexations is sorest to princely flesh it were hard to say;
but as to the books, O Brahmin, squeeze &rsquo;em!&rsquo;&nbsp;
The Brahmin, understanding well what the order to &lsquo;squeeze
&rsquo;em&rsquo; meant (for he was a bookman himself, and knew
that, as there goes much water and little flavour to the making
of a very big pumpkin, so there go much words and few thoughts to
the making of a very big book), set to work, aided by many
scribes&mdash;striking out all the idle words from every book in
the library; and when the essence of them had been extracted it
was found that ten camels could carry that library without
ruffling a hair.&nbsp; And therefore the Brahmin was appointed
&lsquo;Grand Squeezer&rsquo; of the realm.&nbsp; Ages after this,
another prince, who loved reading much and other pleasures a good
deal more, called the Grand Squeezer of his time and said:
&lsquo;Thy duties are neglected, O Grand Squeezer!&nbsp; Thy life
depends upon the measure of thy squeezing.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thereupon
the Grand Squeezer, in fear and trembling, set to work and
squeezed and squeezed till the whole library became at last a
load that a foal would have laughed at, for it consisted but of
one book, a tiny volume, containing four maxims.&nbsp; Yet the
wisdom in the last library was the wisdom in the first.</p>
<p>The appearance of Mr. Skelton&rsquo;s condensation of the
&lsquo;Noctes Ambrosian&aelig;&rsquo; reminds us of this story,
and of a certain solemn warning we always find it our <a
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>duty to
administer to those who show a propensity towards the baneful
coxcombry of authorship&mdash;the warning that the literature of
our country is already in a fair way of dying for the want of a
Grand Squeezer, and that unless such a functionary be appointed
within the next ten years, it will be smothered by itself.&nbsp;
Yet our Government will keep granting pension after pension to
those whom the Duke of Wellington used to call &lsquo;the writing
fellows,&rsquo; for adding to the camel&rsquo;s burden, instead
of distributing the same amount among an army of diligent and
well-selected squeezers.&nbsp; We say an army of squeezers, for
it is not merely that almost every man, woman, and child among us
who can write, prints, while nobody reads, and, to judge from the
&lsquo;spelling bees,&rsquo; nobody even spells, but that the
fecundity of man as a &lsquo;writing animal&rsquo; is on the
increase, and each one requires a squeezer to himself.&nbsp; This
is the alarming thing.&nbsp; Where are we to find so many
squeezers?&nbsp; Nay, in many cases there needs a separate
sub-squeezer for the writer&rsquo;s every book.&nbsp; Take, for
instance, the case of the Carlyle squeezer&mdash;what more could
be expected from him in a lifetime than that he should squeeze
&lsquo;Frederick the Great&rsquo;&mdash;that enormous, rank and
pungent &lsquo;haggis&rsquo; from which, properly squeezed, such
an ocean would flow of &lsquo;oniony liquid&rsquo; that compared
with it the famous &lsquo;haggis-deluge&rsquo; of the
&lsquo;Noctes&rsquo; which nearly drowned in gravy
&lsquo;Christopher,&rsquo; &lsquo;the Shepherd,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Tickler&rsquo; in Ambrose&rsquo;s parlour, would be, both
for quantity and flavour, but &lsquo;a beaker full of the sweet
South&rsquo;?&nbsp; Yet what would be the squeezing of Mr.
Carlyle; what would be the squeezing of De Quincey, or of Landor,
or of Southey, to the squeezing of the tremendous Professor
Wilson&mdash;the mighty Christopher, who for about thirty years
literally <a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>talked in type upon every matter of which he had any
knowledge, and upon every matter of which he had none; whose
&lsquo;words, words, words&rsquo; are, indeed, as Hallam, with
unconscious irony, says, &lsquo;as the rush of mighty
waters&rsquo;?</p>
<p>What would be left after the squeezing of him it would be hard
to guess; for, says the Chinese proverb, &lsquo;if what is said
be not to the purpose, a single word is already too
much.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Skelton should have borne this maxim in mind in his
manipulations upon the &lsquo;Noctes
Ambrosian&aelig;.&rsquo;&nbsp; He loves the memory of the fine
old Scotsman, and has squeezed this enormous pumpkin with fingers
that are too timid of grip.&nbsp; In squeezing Professor Wilson
you cannot overdo it.&nbsp; There are certain parts we should
have especially liked squeezed away; and among these&mdash;will
Mr. Skelton pardon us?&mdash;are the &lsquo;amazingly
humourous&rsquo; ones, such as the &lsquo;opening of the
haggis,&rsquo; which, Mr. Skelton tells us, &lsquo;manifests the
humour of conception as well as the humour of character, in a
measure that has seldom been surpassed by the greatest
masters&rsquo;; &lsquo;the amazing humour&rsquo; of which
consists in the Shepherd&rsquo;s sticking his supper knife into a
&lsquo;haggis&rsquo; (a sheep&rsquo;s paunch filled with the
&lsquo;pluck&rsquo; minced, with suet, onions, salt, and pepper),
and thereby setting free such a flood of gravy that the whole
party have to jump upon the chairs and tables to save themselves
from being drowned in it!&nbsp; In truth, Mr. Skelton should have
reversed his method of selection; and if, in operating upon the
Professor&rsquo;s twelve remaining volumes, he will, instead of
retaining, omit everything &lsquo;amazingly humourous,&rsquo; he
will be the best Wilson-squeezer imaginable.</p>
<p>Yet, his intentions here were as good as could be.&nbsp; The
&lsquo;Noctes&rsquo; are dying of dropsy, so Mr. Skelton, to <a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>save them,
squeezes away all the political events&mdash;so important once,
so unimportant now&mdash;all the foolish laudation, and more
foolish abuse of those who took part in them.&nbsp; He eliminates
all the critiques upon all those &lsquo;greatest poems&rsquo; and
those &lsquo;greatest novels of the age&rsquo; written by
Christopher&rsquo;s friends&mdash;friends so famous once, so
peacefully forgotten now.&nbsp; And he has left what he calls the
&lsquo;Comedy of the Noctes Ambrosian&aelig;,&rsquo; i.e.
&lsquo;that portion of the work which deals with or presents
directly and dramatically to the reader, human life, and
character, and passion, as distinguished from that portion of it
which is critical, and devoted to the discussion of subjects of
literary, artistic, or political interest only.&rsquo;&nbsp; And,
although Mr. Skelton uses thus the word &lsquo;comedy&rsquo; in
its older and wider meaning, it is evident that it is as an
&lsquo;amazing humourist&rsquo; that he would present to our
generation the great Christopher North.&nbsp; And assuredly, at
this the &lsquo;delighted spirit&rsquo; of Christopher smiles
delightedly in Hades.&nbsp; For, however the &lsquo;Comic
Muse&rsquo; may pout upon hearing from Mr. Skelton that
&lsquo;the &ldquo;Noctes Ambrosian&aelig;&rdquo; belong to
her,&rsquo; it is clear that the one great desire of
Wilson&rsquo;s life was to cultivate her&mdash;was to be an
&lsquo;amazing humourist,&rsquo; in short.&nbsp; It is clear,
besides, that there was one special kind of humour which he most
of all affected, that which we call technically
&lsquo;Rabelaisian.&rsquo;&nbsp; To have gone down to posterity
as the great English Rabelaisian of the nineteenth century,
Christopher North would have freely given all his deserved fame
as a prose poet, and all the thirty thousand pounds hard cash of
which he was despoiled to boot.&nbsp; His personality was
enormous.&nbsp; He had more of that demonic element&mdash;of
which since Goethe&rsquo;s time we have heard so much&mdash;than
any man in Scotland.&nbsp; Everybody seems to have been dominated
<a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>by
him.&nbsp; De Quincey, with a finer intellect than even his
own&mdash;and that is using strong language&mdash;looked up to
him as a spaniel looks up to his master.&nbsp; It is positively
ludicrous, while reading De Quincey&rsquo;s &lsquo;Autobiographic
Sketches,&rsquo; to come again and again upon the na&iuml;ve
refrain: &lsquo;I think so, so does Professor
Wilson.&rsquo;&nbsp; Gigantic as was the egotism of the
Opium-eater, it was overshadowed by the still more gigantic
egotism of Christopher North.&nbsp; In this, as in everything
else, he was the opposite of the finest Scottish humourist since
Burns, Sir Walter Scott.&nbsp; Scott&rsquo;s desire was to create
eccentric humourous characters, but to remain the simple Scottish
gentleman himself.&nbsp; Wilson&rsquo;s great ambition was to be
an eccentric humourous character himself; for your superlative
egotist has scarcely even the wish to create.&nbsp; He would like
the universe to himself.&nbsp; If Wilson had created Falstaff,
and if you had expressed to him your admiration of the
truthfulness of that character, he would have taken you by the
shoulder and said, with a smile: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you see, you
fool, that Falstaff is I&mdash;John Wilson?&rsquo;&nbsp; He
always wished it to be known that the Ettrick Shepherd and
Tickler were John Wilson&mdash;as much Wilson as Kit North
himself, or, rather, what he would have liked John Wilson to be
considered.&nbsp; This determination to be a humourous character
it was&mdash;and no lack of literary ambition&mdash;that caused
him to squander his astonishing powers in the way that Mr.
Skelton, and all of us who admire the man, lament.</p>
<p>Many articles in &lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo;&mdash;notably the one
upon Shakspeare&rsquo;s four great tragedies and the one in which
he discusses Coleridge&rsquo;s poetry&mdash;show that his insight
into the principles of literary art was true and deep&mdash;far
too true and deep for him to be ignorant of this inexorable law,
that nothing can live in literature <a name="page196"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 196</span>without form, nothing but humour;
but that, let this flowery crown of literature show itself in the
most formless kind of magazine-article or review-essay, and the
writer is secure of his place according to his merits.</p>
<p>Has Wilson secured such a place?&nbsp; We fear not; and if
Skelton were to ask us, on our oath, why Wilson&rsquo;s fourteen
volumes of brilliant, eloquent, and picturesque writing are
already in a sadly moribund state, while such slight and
apparently fugitive essays as the &lsquo;Coverley&rsquo; papers,
the essays of Elia, and the hurried review articles of Sydney
Smith, seem to have more vitality than ever, we fear that our
answer would have to be this bipartite one: first, that mere
elaborated intellectual &lsquo;humour&rsquo; has the seeds of
dissolution in it from the beginning, while temperamental humour
alone can live; and, secondly, that Wilson was probably not
temperamentally a humourist at all, and certainly not
temperamentally a Rabelaisian.&nbsp; But let us, by way of excuse
for this rank blasphemy, say what precise meaning we attach to
the word &lsquo;Rabelaisian&rsquo;&mdash;though the subject is so
wide that there is no knowing whither it may lead us.&nbsp;
Without venturing upon a new definition of humour, this we will
venture to say, that true humour, that is to say, the humour of
temperament, is conveniently divisible into two kinds: Cervantic
humour, i.e. the amused, philosophic mood of the
dramatist&mdash;the comedian; and Rabelaisian humour, i.e. the
lawless abandonment of mirth, flowing mostly from exuberance of
health and animal spirits, with a strong recognition of the
absurdity of human life and the almighty joke of the
Cosmos&mdash;a mood which in literature is rarer than in
life&mdash;rarer, perhaps, because animal spirits are not the
common and characteristic accompaniments of the literary
temperament.</p>
<p><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>Of
Cervantic humour Wilson has, of course, absolutely nothing.&nbsp;
For this, the fairest flower in the garden, cannot often take
root, save in the most un-egotistic souls.&nbsp; It belongs to
the Chaucers, the Shakspeares, the Moli&egrave;res, the Addisons,
the Fieldings, the Steeles, the Scotts, the Miss Austens, the
George Eliots&mdash;upon whom the rich tides of the outer life
come breaking and drowning the egotism and yearning for
self-expression which is the life of smaller souls.&nbsp; Among
these&mdash;to whom to create is everything&mdash;Sterne would
perhaps have been greatest of all had he never known Hall
Stevenson, and never read Rabelais; while Dickens&rsquo;s growth
was a development from Rabelaisianism to Cervantism.&nbsp; But
surely so delicate a critic as Mr. Skelton has often proved
himself to be, is not going to seriously tell us that there is
one ray of dramatic humour to be found in Wilson.&nbsp; Why, the
man had not even the mechanical skill of varying the locutions
and changing the styles of his two or three characters.&nbsp;
Even the humourless Plato could do that.&nbsp; Even the
humourless Landor could do that.&nbsp; But, strip the
&lsquo;Shepherd&rsquo;s&rsquo; talk of its Scottish accent and it
is nothing but those same appalling mighty waters whose rush in
the &lsquo;Recreations&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Essays&rsquo; we are
so familiar with.&nbsp; While, as to his clumsy caricature of the
sesquipedalian language of De Quincey, that is such obtrusive
caricature that illusion seems to be purposely destroyed, and the
&lsquo;Opium-Eater&rsquo; becomes a fantastic creature of Farce,
and not of Comedy at all.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;amazing humour&rsquo; of Wilson, then, is not
Cervantic.&nbsp; Is it Rabelaisian?&nbsp; Again, we fear
not.&nbsp; Very likely the genuine Rabelaisian does not commonly
belong to the &lsquo;writing fellows&rsquo; at all.&nbsp; We have
had the good luck to come across two Rabelaisians in our
time.&nbsp; <a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>One was a lawyer, who hated literature with a beautiful
and a pathetic hatred.&nbsp; The other was a drunken cobbler, who
loved it with a beautiful and a pathetic love.&nbsp; And we have
just heard from one of our finest critics that a true Rabelaisian
is, at this moment, to be found&mdash;where he ought to be
found&mdash;at Stratford-on-Avon.&nbsp; This is
interesting.&nbsp; Yet, as there were heroes before Agamemnon, so
there were Rabelaisians, even among the &lsquo;writing
fellows,&rsquo; before Rabelais; the greatest of them, of course,
being Aristophanes, though, from all we hear, it may be
reasonably feared that when Alcibiades, instead of getting
damages out of Eupolis for libel, &lsquo;in a duck-pond drowned
him,&rsquo; he thereby extinguished for ever a Rabelaisian of the
very first rank.&nbsp; But we can only judge from what we have;
and, to say nothing of the tabooed Lysistrata, the
&lsquo;Birds&rsquo; alone puts Aristophanes at the top of all
pre-Rabelaisian Rabelaisians.&nbsp; But when those immortal words
came from that dying bed at Meudon: &lsquo;Let down the curtain;
the farce is done,&rsquo; they were prophetic as regards the
literary Rabelaisians&mdash;prophetic in this, that no writer has
since thoroughly caught the Rabelaisian mood&mdash;the mood, that
is, of the cosmic humourist, gasping with merriment as he gobbles
huge piles of meat and guzzles from huge flagons of wine.&nbsp;
Yet, if his mantle has fallen upon no one pair of shoulders, a
corner of it has dropped upon several; for the great Cur&eacute;
divides his qualities among his followers impartially, giving but
one to each, like the pine-apple in the &lsquo;Paradise of
Fruits,&rsquo; from which every other fruit in the garden drew
its own peculiar flavour, and then charged its neighbour fruits
with stealing theirs.&nbsp; Among a few others, it may be said
that the cosmic humour has fallen to Swift (in whom, however,
earnestness half stifled it) Sterne, and <a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>Richter;
while the animal spirits&mdash;the love of life&mdash;the fine
passion for victuals and drink&mdash;has fallen to several more,
notably to Thomas Amory, the creator of &lsquo;John
Buncle&rsquo;; to Herrick, to old John Skelton, to Burns (in the
&lsquo;Jolly Beggars&rsquo;), to John Skinner, the author of
&lsquo;Tullochgorum.&rsquo;&nbsp; Shakspeare, having everything,
has, of course, both sides of Rabelaisianism as well as
Cervantism.&nbsp; Some of the scenes in &lsquo;Henry the
Fourth&rsquo; and &lsquo;Henry the Fifth&rsquo; are rich with
it.&nbsp; So is &lsquo;Twelfth Night,&rsquo; to go no
further.&nbsp; Dickens&rsquo;s Rabelaisianism stopped with
&lsquo;Pickwick.&rsquo;&nbsp; If Hood&rsquo;s gastric fluid had
been a thousand times stronger, he would have been the greatest
Rabelaisian since Rabelais.&nbsp; A good man, if his juices are
right, may grow into Cervantism, but you cannot grow into
Rabelaisianism.&nbsp; Neither can you simulate it without coming
to grief.&nbsp; Yet, of simulated Rabelaisianism all literature
is, alas! full, and this is how the simulators come to grief;
simulated cosmic humour becomes the self-conscious grimacing and
sad posture-making of the harlequin sage, such as we see in those
who make life hideous by imitating Mr. Carlyle.&nbsp; This is
bad.&nbsp; But far worse is simulated animal spirits, i.e.
jolly-doggism.&nbsp; This is insupportable.&nbsp; For we ask the
reader&mdash;who may very likely have been to an
undergraduates&rsquo; wine-party, or to a medical students&rsquo;
revel, or who may have read the &lsquo;Noctes
Ambrosian&aelig;&rsquo;&mdash;we seriously and earnestly ask him
whether, among all the dreary things of this sometimes dreary
life, there is anything half so dreadful as jolly-doggism.</p>
<p>And now we come reluctantly to the point.&nbsp; It breaks our
heart to say to Mr. Skelton&mdash;for we believed in Professor
Wilson once&mdash;it breaks our heart to say that Wilson&rsquo;s
Rabelaisianism is nothing but jolly-doggism of <a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>the most
prepense, affected, and piteous kind.&nbsp; In reading the
&lsquo;Noctes&rsquo; we feel, as Jefferson&rsquo;s Rip van Winkle
must have felt, surrounded by the ghosts on the top of the
Katskill mountains.&nbsp; We say to ourselves, &lsquo;How
comparatively comfortable we should feel if those bloodless,
marrowless spectres wouldn&rsquo;t pretend to be jolly&mdash;if
they would not pretend to be enjoying their phantom bowls and
their ghostly liquor!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Though John Skinner and Thomas Amory have but a small
endowment of the great master&rsquo;s humour, their animal
spirits are genuine.&nbsp; They do not hop, skip, and jump for
effect.&nbsp; Their friskiness is the friskiness of the retriever
puppy when let loose; of the urchin who runs shrieking against
the shrieking wind in the unsyllabled tongue that all creatures
know, &lsquo;I live, I live, I live!&rsquo;&nbsp; But, whatever
might have been the physical health of Wilson, there is a hollow
ring about the literary cheerfulness of the &lsquo;Noctes&rsquo;
that, notwithstanding all that has been said to the contrary,
makes us think that he was at heart almost a melancholy man; that
makes us think that the real Wilson is the Wilson of the
&lsquo;Isle of Palms,&rsquo; &lsquo;The City of the
Plague,&rsquo; of the &lsquo;Trials of Margaret Lyndsay,&rsquo;
of the &lsquo;Lights and Shadows of Scottish Life,&rsquo; Wilson,
the Wordsworthian, the lover of Nature, whom Jeffrey describes
when he says that &lsquo;almost the only passions with which his
poetry is conversant are the gentler sympathies of our
nature&mdash;tender compassion&mdash;confiding affection, and
gentleness and sorrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He wished to be thought a rollicking, devil-me-care
protagonist, a good-tempered giant ready to swallow with a guffaw
the whole cockney army if necessary.&nbsp; This kind of man he
may have been&mdash;Mr. Skelton inferentially says he was; all we
know is that his writings <a name="page201"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 201</span>lead us to think he was playing a
part.&nbsp; A temperamental humourist, we say decidedly, he was
not.</p>
<p>Is there, then, no humour to be found in this book?&nbsp; In a
certain sense no doubt humour may be found there.&nbsp; Just as
science tells us that all the stars in heaven are composed of
pretty much the same elements as the familiar earth on which we
live, or dream we live, so is every one among us composed of the
same elements as all the rest, and one of the most important
elements common to all human kind is humour.&nbsp; And, if a man
takes to expressing in literary forms the little humour within
him, it is but natural that the more vigorous, the more agile is
his intellect and the greater is his literary skill, the more
deceptive is his mere intellectual humour, the more telling his
wit.&nbsp; Now, Wilson&rsquo;s intellect was exceedingly and
wonderfully fine.&nbsp; As strong as it was swift, it could fly
over many a wide track of knowledge and of speculation unkenned
by not a few of those who now-a-days would underrate him,
dropping a rain of diamonds from his wings like the fabulous bird
of North Cathay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No sooner had the article appeared than Appleton went to Danes
Inn and saw the author of it.&nbsp; Appleton was in a state of
great excitement, and indeed of great rage, for at that time
there was considerable rivalry between the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Academy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You belong to us,&rdquo; said Appleton.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The &lsquo;Academy&rsquo; is the proper place for
you.&nbsp; You and I have been friends for a long time, and so
have Rossetti and the rest of us, and yet you go into the
enemy&rsquo;s camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And shall I tell you why I have joined the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; in place of the
&lsquo;Academy&rsquo;?&rdquo; said <a name="page202"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 202</span>Watts; &ldquo;it is simply because
MacColl invited me, and you did not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For months and months I have been urging you to write
in the &lsquo;Academy,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Appleton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true, no doubt,&rdquo; said Watts, &ldquo;but
while MacColl offered me an important post on his paper, and in
the literary department, too, you invited me to do the drudgery
of melting down into two columns books upon metaphysics.&nbsp; It
is too late, my dear boy, it is too late.&nbsp; If to join the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; is to go into the camp of the
Philistines, why, then, a Philistine am I.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I do not know whether at that time Shirley (as Sir John
Skelton was then called) and Mr. Watts-Dunton were friends, but I
know they were friends afterwards.&nbsp; Shirley, in his
&lsquo;Reminiscences&rsquo; of Rossetti, like most of his
friends, urged Mr. Watts-Dunton to write a memoir of the
poet-painter.&nbsp; I do know, however, that Mr. Watts-Dunton,
besides cherishing an affectionate memory of Sir John Skelton as
a man, is a genuine admirer of the Shirley Essays.&nbsp; I have
heard him say more than once that Skelton&rsquo;s style had a
certain charm for him, and he could not understand why
Skelton&rsquo;s position is not as great as it deserves to
be.&nbsp; &lsquo;Scotsmen,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;often complain
that English critics are slow to do them justice.&nbsp; This idea
was the bane of my dear old friend John Nichol&rsquo;s
life.&nbsp; He really seemed to think that he was languishing and
withering under the ban of a great anti-Scottish conspiracy known
as the Savile Club.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, however, there is
nothing whatever in the idea that a Scotsman does not fight on
equal terms with the Englishman in the great literary cockpit of
London.&nbsp; To say the truth, the Scottish cock <a
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>is really
longer in spur and beak than the English cock, and can more than
take care of himself.&nbsp; For my part, with the exception of
Swinburne, I really think that my most intimate friends are
either Irish, Scottish, or Welsh.&nbsp; But I have sometimes
thought that if Skelton had been an Englishman and moved in
English sets, he would have taken an enormously higher position
than he has secured, for he would have been more known among
writers, and the more he was known the more he was
liked.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As will be seen further on, before the review of the
&lsquo;Comedy of the Noctes Ambrosian&aelig;&rsquo; appeared, Mr.
Watts-Dunton had contributed to the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo;
an article on &lsquo;The Art of Interviewing.&rsquo;&nbsp; From
this time forward he became the chief critic of the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um,&rsquo; and for nearly a quarter of a
century&mdash;that is to say, until he published &lsquo;The
Coming of Love,&rsquo; when he practically, I think, ceased to
write reviews of any kind&mdash;he enriched its pages with
critical essays the peculiar features of which were their daring
formulation of first principles, their profound generalizations,
their application of modern scientific knowledge to the phenomena
of literature, and, above all, their richly idiosyncratic
style&mdash;a style so personal that, as Groome said in the
remarks quoted in an earlier chapter, it signs all his work.</p>
<p>As I have more than once said, it is necessary to dwell with
some fulness upon these criticisms, because the relation between
his critical and his creative work is of the closest kind.&nbsp;
Indeed, it has been said by Rossetti that &lsquo;the subtle and
original generalizations upon the first principles of poetry
which illumine his writings could only have come to him by a
duplicate exercise of his brain when he was writing his own
poetry.&rsquo;&nbsp; The <a name="page204"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 204</span>great critics of poetry have nearly
all been great poets.&nbsp; Rossetti used humourously to call him
&lsquo;The Symposiarch,&rsquo; and no doubt the influence of his
long practice of oral criticism in Cheyne Walk, at Kelmscott
Manor, as well as in such opposite gatherings as those at Dr.
Marston&rsquo;s, Madox Brown&rsquo;s, and Mrs. Procter&rsquo;s,
may be traced in his writings.&nbsp; For his most effective
criticism has always the personal magic of the living voice,
producing on the reader the winsome effect of spontaneous
conversation overheard.&nbsp; Its variety of manner, as well as
of subject, differentiates it from all other contemporary
criticism.&nbsp; In it are found racy erudition, powerful
thought, philosophical speculation, irony silkier than the silken
irony of M. Anatole France, airily mischievous humour, and a
perpetual coruscation of the comic spirit.&nbsp; To the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; he contributed essays upon all sorts
of themes such as &lsquo;The Poetic Interpretation of
Nature,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Troubadours and
Trouv&egrave;res,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Children of the Open
Air,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Gypsies,&rsquo; &lsquo;Cosmic
Humour,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Effect of Evolution upon
Literature.&rsquo;&nbsp; And although the most complete and most
modern critical system in the English language lies buried in the
vast ocean of the &lsquo;Examiner,&rsquo; the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um,&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Encyclop&aelig;dia
Britannica,&rsquo; there are still divers who are aware of its
existence, as is proved by the latest appreciation of Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s work, that contributed by Madame Galimberti,
the accomplished wife of the Italian minister, to the
&lsquo;Rivista d&rsquo; Italia.&rsquo;&nbsp; In this article she
makes frequent allusions to the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo;
articles, and quotes freely from them.&nbsp; Rossetti once said
that &lsquo;the reason why Theodore Watts was so little known
outside the inner circle of letters was that he sought obscurity
as eagerly as other men sought fame&rsquo;; but although his
indifference to literary reputation is so <a
name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>invincible
that it has baffled all the efforts of all his friends to
persuade him to collect his critical essays, his influence over
contemporary criticism has been and is and will be profound.</p>
<p>There is no province of pure literature which his criticism
leaves untouched; but it is in poetry that it culminates.&nbsp;
His treatise in the &lsquo;Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica&rsquo;
on &lsquo;Poetry&rsquo; is alone sufficient to show how deep has
been his study of poetic principles.&nbsp; The essay on the
&lsquo;Sonnet,&rsquo; too, which appeared in
&lsquo;Chambers&rsquo;s Encyclop&aelig;dia,&rsquo; is admitted by
critics of the sonnet to be the one indispensable treatise on the
subject.&nbsp; It has been much discussed by foreign critics,
especially by Dr. Karl Leutzner in his treatise, &lsquo;Uber das
Sonett in der Englischen Dichtung.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The principles upon which he carried on criticism in the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; are admirably expressed in the
following dialogue between him and Mr. G. B. Burgin, who
approached him as the representative of the
&lsquo;Idler.&rsquo;&nbsp; The allusion to the &lsquo;smart
slaters&rsquo; will be sufficient to indicate the approximate
date of the interview.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Having read your treatise on poetry in the
&lsquo;Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica,&rsquo; which, it is said,
has been an influence in every European literature, I want to ask
whether a critic so deeply learned in all the secrets of poetic
art, and who has had the advantages of comparing his own opinions
with those of all the great poets of his time, takes a hopeful or
despondent view of the condition of English poetry at the present
moment.&nbsp; There are those who run down the present generation
of poets, but on this subject the men who are really entitled to
speak can be counted on the fingers of one hand.&nbsp; <a
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>It would be
valuable to know whether our leading critic is in sympathy with
the poetry of the present hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not for a moment admit that I am the leading
critic.&nbsp; To say the truth, I am often amused, and often
vexed, at the grotesque misconception that seems to be afloat as
to my relation to criticism.&nbsp; Years ago, Russell Lowell told
me that all over the United States I was identified with every
paragraph of a certain critical journal in which I sometimes
write; and, judging from the droll attacks that are so often made
upon me by outside paragraph writers, the same misconception
seems to be spreading in England&mdash;attacks which the smiling
and knowing public well understands to spring from writing men
who have not been happy in their relations with the
reviewers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been remarked that you never answer any attack
in the newspapers, howsoever unjust or absurd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not believe in answering attacks.&nbsp; The
public, as I say, knows that there is a mysterious and
inscrutable yearning in the slow-worm to bite with the fangs of
the adder, and every attack upon a writer does him more good than
praise would do.&nbsp; But, as a matter of fact, I have no
connexion whatever with any journal save that of a student of
letters who finds it convenient on occasion to throw his
meditations upon literary art and the laws that govern it in the
form of a review.&nbsp; It is a bad method, no doubt, of giving
expression to one&rsquo;s excogitations, and although I do
certainly contrive to put careful criticisms into my articles, I
cannot imagine more unbusinesslike reviewing than mine.&nbsp; Yet
it has one good quality, I think&mdash;it is never
unkindly.&nbsp; I never will take a book for review unless I can
say something in its favour, and a good deal in its
favour.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>&ldquo;Then you never practise the smart
&lsquo;slating&rsquo; which certain would-be critics indulge
in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&nbsp; In the first place, it would afford me no
pleasure to give pain to a young writer.&nbsp; In the next place,
this &lsquo;smart slating,&rsquo; as you call it, is the very
easiest thing of achievement in the world.&nbsp; Give me the aid
of a good amanuensis, and I will engage to dictate as many miles
of such smart &lsquo;slating&rsquo; as could be achieved by any
six of the smart slaters.&nbsp; A charming phrase of yours,
&lsquo;smart slaters&rsquo;!&nbsp; But I leave such work to them,
as do all the really true critics of my time&mdash;men to whom
the insolence which the smart slaters seem to mistake for wit
would be as easy as to me, only that, like me, they hold such
work in contempt.&nbsp; Take a critic like Mr. Traill, for
instance.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Fate has decreed that many hours
every day of his valuable life are wasted on &lsquo;leader&rsquo;
writing, but there is in any one of his literary essays more wit
and humour than could be achieved by all the smart writers
combined; and yet how kind is he! going out of his way to see
merit in a rising poet, and to foster it.&nbsp; Or take Grant
Allen, whose good things flow so naturally from him.&nbsp; While
the typical smart writer is illustrating the primal curse by
making his poor little spiteful jokes in the sweat of his poor
little spiteful brow, Grant Allen&rsquo;s good-natured sayings
have the very wit that the unlucky sweater and
&lsquo;slater&rsquo; is trying for.&nbsp; Read what he said about
William Watson, and see how kind he is.&nbsp; Compare his
geniality with the scurrility of the smart writers.&nbsp; Again,
take Andrew Lang, perhaps the most variously accomplished man of
letters in England or in Europe, and compare his geniality with
the scurrility of the smart writers.&nbsp; But it was not, I
suppose, of such as they that you came to talk about.&nbsp; You
are asking me whether I am in sympathy with the <a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>younger
writers of my time.&nbsp; My answer is that I cannot imagine any
one to be more in sympathy with them than I am.&nbsp; In spite of
the disparity of years between me and the youngest of them, I
believe I number many of them among my warmest and most loyal
friends, and that is because I am in true sympathy with their
work and their aims.&nbsp; No doubt there are some points in
which they and I agree to differ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what about our contemporary novelists?&nbsp;
Perhaps you do not give attention to fiction?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give attention to novels!&nbsp; Why, if I did not, I
should not give attention to literature at all.&nbsp; In a true
and deep sense all pure literature is fiction&mdash;to use an
extremely inadequate and misleading word as a substitute for the
right phrase, &lsquo;imaginative representation.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;The Iliad,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Odyssey,&rsquo; &lsquo;The
&AElig;neid,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Divina Commedia,&rsquo; are
fundamentally novels, though in verse, as certainly novels as is
the latest story by the most popular of our writers.&nbsp; The
greatest of all writers of the novelette is the old Burmese
parable writer, who gave us the story of the girl-mother and the
mustard-seed.&nbsp; A time which has given birth to such
novelists as many of ours of the present day is a great, and a
very great, time for the English novel.&nbsp; Criticism will have
to recognize, and at once, that the novel, now-a-days, stands
plump in the front rank of the &lsquo;literature of power,&rsquo;
and if criticism does not so recognize it, so much the worse for
criticism, I think.&nbsp; That the novel will grow in importance
is, I say, quite certain.&nbsp; In such a time as ours (as I have
said in print), poetry is like the knickerbockers of a growing
boy&mdash;it has become too small somehow; it is not quite large
enough for the growing limbs of life.&nbsp; The novel is more
flexible; it can be stretched to fit the muscles as they
swell.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
209</span>&ldquo;I will conclude by asking you what I have asked
another eminent critic: What is your opinion of anonymity in
criticism?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there I am a &lsquo;galled jade&rsquo; that must
needs &lsquo;wince&rsquo; a little.&nbsp; No doubt I write
anonymously myself, but that is because I have not yet mastered
that dislike of publicity which has kept me back, and my writing
seems to lose its elasticity with its anonymity.&nbsp; The chief
argument against anonymous criticism I take to be this: That any
scribbler who can get upon an important journal is at once
clothed with the journal&rsquo;s own authority&mdash;and the same
applies, of course, to the dishonest critic; and this is surely
very serious.&nbsp; With regard to dishonest criticism it is
impossible for the most wary editor to be always on his guard
against it.&nbsp; An editor cannot read all the books, nor can he
know the innumerable ramifications of the literary world.&nbsp;
When Jones asks him for Brown&rsquo;s book for review, the editor
cannot know that Jones has determined to praise it or to cut it
up irrespective of its merits; and then, when the puff or attack
comes in, it is at once clothed with the authority, not of
Jones&rsquo;s name, but that of the journal.</p>
<p>In the literary arena itself the truth of the case may be
known, but not in the world outside, and it must not be supposed
but that great injustice may flow from this.&nbsp; I myself have
more than once heard a good book spoken of with contempt in
London Society, and heard quoted the very words of some hostile
review which I have known to be the work of a spiteful foe of the
writer of the book, or of some paltry fellow who was quite
incompetent to review anything.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that the day of the &lsquo;smart slaters&rsquo; is over,
it is interesting to read in connection with these obiter dicta
<a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>the
following passage from the article in which Mr. Watts-Dunton, on
the seventieth birthday of the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um,&rsquo;
spoke of its record and its triumphs:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The enormous responsibility of anonymous
criticism is seen in every line contributed by the Maurice and
Sterling group who spoke through its columns.&nbsp; Even for
those who are behind the scenes and know that the critique
expresses the opinion of only one writer, it is difficult not to
be impressed by the accent of authority in the editorial
&lsquo;we.&rsquo;&nbsp; But with regard to the general public,
the reader of a review article finds it impossible to escape from
the authority of the &lsquo;we,&rsquo; and the power of a single
writer to benefit or to injure an author is so great that none
but the most deeply conscientious men ought to enter the ranks of
the anonymous reviewers.&nbsp; These were the views of Maurice
and Sterling; and that they are shared by all the best writers of
our time there can be no doubt.&nbsp; Some very illustrious men
have given very emphatic expression to them.&nbsp; On a certain
memorable occasion, at a little dinner-party at 16 Cheyne Walk,
one of the guests related an anecdote of his having accidentally
met an old acquaintance who had deeply disgraced himself, and
told how he had stood &lsquo;dividing the swift mind&rsquo; as to
whether he could or could not offer the man his hand.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I think I should have offered him mine,&rsquo; said
Rossetti, &lsquo;although no one detests his offence more than I
do.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then the conversation ran upon the question
as to the various kinds of offenders with whom old friends could
not shake hands.&nbsp; &lsquo;There is one kind of
miscreant,&rsquo; said Rossetti, &lsquo;whom you have forgotten
to name&mdash;a miscreant who in kind of meanness and infamy
cannot well be beaten, the man who in an anonymous <a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>journal
tells the world that a poem or picture is bad when he knows it to
be good.&nbsp; That is the man who should never defile my hand by
his touch.&nbsp; By God, if I met such a man at a dinner-table I
must not kick him, I suppose; but I could not, and would not,
taste bread and salt with him.&nbsp; I would quietly get up and
go.&rsquo;&nbsp; Tennyson, on afterwards being told this story,
said, &lsquo;And who would not do the same?&nbsp; Such a man has
been guilty of sacrilege&mdash;sacrilege against
art.&rsquo;&nbsp; Maurice, Sterling, and the other writers in the
first volume of the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; worked on the
great principle that the critic&rsquo;s primary duty is to seek
and to bring to light those treasures of art and literature that
the busy world is only too apt to pass by.&nbsp; Their pet
abhorrence was the cheap smartness of Jeffrey and certain of his
coadjutors; and from its commencement the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; has striven to avoid slashing and
smart writing.&nbsp; A difficult thing to avoid, no doubt, for
nothing is so easy to achieve as that insolent and vulgar
slashing which the half-educated amateur thinks so clever.&nbsp;
Of all forms of writing, the founders of the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; held the shallow, smart style to be
the cheapest and also the most despicable.&nbsp; And here again
the views of the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; have remained
unchanged.&nbsp; The critic who works &lsquo;without a conscience
or an aim&rsquo; knows only too well that it pays to pander to
the most lamentable of all the weaknesses of human
nature&mdash;the love that people have of seeing each other
attacked and vilified; it pays for a time, until it defeats
itself.&nbsp; For although man has a strong instinct for
admiration&mdash;else had he never reached his present position
in the conscious world&mdash;he has, running side by side with
this instinct, another strong instinct&mdash;the instinct for
contempt.&nbsp; A reviewer&rsquo;s ridicule poured upon a writer
<a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>titillates the reader with a sense of his own
superiority.&nbsp; It is by pandering to this lower instinct that
the unprincipled journalist hopes to kill two birds with one
stone&mdash;to gratify his own malignity and low-bred love of
insolence, and to make profit while doing so.&nbsp; Although
cynicism may certainly exist alongside great talent, it is far
more likely to be found where there is no talent at all.&nbsp;
Many brilliant writers have written in this journal, but rarely,
if ever, have truth and honesty of criticism been sacrificed for
a smart saying.&nbsp; One of these writers&mdash;the greatest wit
of the nineteenth century&mdash;used to say, in honest
disparagement of what were considered his own prodigious powers
of wit, &lsquo;I will engage in six lessons to teach any man to
do this kind of thing as well as I do, if he thinks it worth his
while to learn.&rsquo;&nbsp; And the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um,&rsquo; at the time when Hood was reviewing
Dickens in its columns, could have said the same thing.&nbsp; The
smart reviewer, however, mistakes insolence for wit, and among
the low-minded insolence needs no teaching.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, in the office of an important literary organ there
is always a kind of terror lest, in the necessary hurry of the
work, a contributor should &lsquo;come down a cropper&rsquo; over
some matter of fact, and open the door to troublesome
correspondence.&nbsp; As Mr. Watts-Dunton has said, the
mysterious &lsquo;we&rsquo; must claim to be Absolute Wisdom, or
where is the authority of the oracle?&nbsp; When a contributor
&lsquo;comes down a cropper,&rsquo; although the matter may be of
infinitesimal importance, the editor cannot, it seems, and never
could (except during the imperial regime of the &lsquo;Saturday
Review&rsquo; under Cook) refuse to insert a correction.&nbsp;
Now, as Mr. Watts-Dunton has said, &lsquo;the smaller the
intelligence, the greater joy does it feel in <a
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>setting
other intelligences right.&rsquo;&nbsp; I have been told that it
was a tradition in the office of the &lsquo;Examiner,&rsquo; and
also in the office of the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um,&rsquo; that
Theodore Watts had not only never been known to &lsquo;come down
a cropper,&rsquo; but had never given the &lsquo;critical
gnats&rsquo; a chance of pretending that he had to.&nbsp; One
day, however, in an article on Frederick Tennyson&rsquo;s poems,
speaking of the position that the poet Alexander Smith occupied
in the early fifties, and contrasting it with the position that
he held at the time the article was written, Mr. Watts-Dunton
affirmed that once on a time Smith&mdash;the same Smith whom
&lsquo;Z&rsquo; (the late William Allingham) had annihilated in
the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo;&mdash;had been admired by Alfred
Tennyson, and also that once on a time Herbert Spencer had
compared a metaphor of Alexander Smith&rsquo;s with the metaphors
of Shakespeare.&nbsp; The touchiness of Spencer was proverbial,
and on the next Monday morning the editor got the following curt
note from the great man:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Will the writer of the review of Mr.
Frederick Tennyson&rsquo;s poems, which was published in your
last number, please say where I have compared the metaphors of
Shakspeare and Alexander Smith?</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Herbert
Spencer</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The editor, taking for granted that the heretofore impeccable
contributor had at last &lsquo;come down a cropper,&rsquo; sent a
proof of Spencer&rsquo;s note to Mr. Watts-Dunton, and intimated
that it had better be printed without any editorial comment at
all.&nbsp; Of course, if Mr. Watts-Dunton had at last &lsquo;come
down a cropper,&rsquo; this would have been the wisest
plan.&nbsp; But he returned <a name="page214"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 214</span>the proof of the letter to the
editor, with the following footnote added to it:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is many years since Mr. Herbert Spencer
printed in one of the magazines an essay dealing with the laws of
cause and effect in literary art&mdash;an essay so searching in
its analyses, and so original in its method and conclusions, that
the workers in pure literature may well be envious of science for
enticing such a leader away from their ranks&mdash;and it is many
years since we had the pleasure of reading it.&nbsp; Our memory
is, therefore, somewhat hazy as to the way in which he introduced
such metaphors by Alexander Smith as &lsquo;I speared him with a
jest,&rsquo; etc.&nbsp; Our only object, however, in alluding to
the subject was to show that a poet now ignored by the criticism
of the hour, a poet who could throw off such Shakspearean
sentences as this&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;My
drooping sails<br />
Flap idly &rsquo;gainst the mast of my intent;<br />
I rot upon the waters when my prow<br />
Should grate the golden isles&mdash;</p>
<p>had once the honour of being admired by Alfred Tennyson and
favourably mentioned by Mr. Herbert Spencer.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Spencer told this to a friend, and with much laughter said,
&lsquo;Of course the article was Theodore Watts&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I
had forgotten entirely what I had said about Shakspeare and
Alexander Smith.&rsquo;</p>
<p>If I were asked to furnish a typical example of that
combination of critical insight, faultless memory, and genial
courtesy, which distinguishes Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s writings,
I think I should select this bland postscript to Spencer&rsquo;s
letter.</p>
<p><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>Another instance of the care and insight with which Mr.
Watts-Dunton always wrote his essays is connected with Robert
Louis Stevenson.&nbsp; It occurred in connection with
&lsquo;Kidnapped.&rsquo;&nbsp; I will quote here Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s own version of the anecdote, which will be
found in the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; review of the Edinburgh
edition of Stevenson&rsquo;s works.&nbsp; The playful allusion to
the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo;s&rsquo; kindness is very
characteristic:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Of Stevenson&rsquo;s sweetness of
disposition and his good sense we could quote many instances; but
let one suffice.&nbsp; When &lsquo;Kidnapped&rsquo; appeared,
although in reviewing it we enjoyed the great pleasure of giving
high praise to certain parts of that delightful narrative, we
refused to be scared from making certain strictures.&nbsp; It
occurred to us that while some portions of the story were full of
that organic detail of which Scott was such a master, and without
which no really vital story can be told, it was not so with
certain other parts.&nbsp; From this we drew the conclusion that
the book really consisted of two distinct parts, two stories
which Stevenson had tried in vain to weld into one.&nbsp; We
surmised that the purely Jacobite adventures of Balfour and Alan
Breck were written first, and that then the writer, anxious to
win the suffrages of the general novel-reader (whose power is so
great with Byles the Butcher), looked about him for some story on
the old lines; that he experienced great difficulty in finding
one; and that he was at last driven upon the old situation of the
villain uncle plotting to make away with the nephew by kidnapping
him and sending him off to the plantations.&nbsp; The
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um,&rsquo; whose kindness towards all writers,
poets and prosemen, great and small, has won for it such an
infinity of gratitude, said this, but in its usual kind and
gentle way.&nbsp; This aroused the wrath of the
Stevensonians.&nbsp; <a name="page216"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 216</span>Yet we were not at all surprised to
get from the author of &lsquo;Kidnapped&rsquo; himself a charming
letter.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This letter appears in Stevenson&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Letters,&rsquo; and by the courtesy of Mr. Sidney Colvin
and Mr. A. M. S. Methuen I am permitted to reprint it
here:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Skerryvore</span>, <span
class="smcap">Bournemouth</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Watts</span>,&mdash;The sight of
the last &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; reminds me of you, and of
my debt now too long due.&nbsp; I wish to thank you for your
notice of &lsquo;Kidnapped&rsquo;; and that not because it was
kind, though for that also I valued it; but in the same sense as
I have thanked you before now for a hundred articles on a hundred
different writers.&nbsp; A critic like you is one who fights the
good fight, contending with stupidity, and I would fain hope not
all in vain; in my own case, for instance, surely not in
vain.</p>
<p>What you say of the two parts in &lsquo;Kidnapped&rsquo; was
felt by no one more painfully than by myself.&nbsp; I began it,
partly as a lark, partly as a pot-boiler; and suddenly it moved,
David and Alan stepped out from the canvas, and I found I was in
another world.&nbsp; But there was the cursed beginning, and a
cursed end must be appended; and our old friend Byles the Butcher
was plainly audible tapping at the back door.&nbsp; So it had to
go into the world, one part (as it does seem to me) alive, one
part merely galvanised: no work, only an essay.&nbsp; For a man
of tentative method, and weak health, and a scarcity of private
means, and not too much of that frugality which is the
artist&rsquo;s proper virtue, the days of sinecures and patrons
look very golden: the days of professional literature very
hard.&nbsp; Yet I do not so far deceive myself as to think I
should change my character by changing my epoch; the sum of
virtue in our books is in a relation of equality to the sum of <a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>virtues in
ourselves; and my &lsquo;Kidnapped&rsquo; was doomed, while still
in the womb and while I was yet in the cradle, to be the thing it
is.</p>
<p>And now to the more genial business of defence.&nbsp; You
attack my fight on board the &lsquo;Covenant,&rsquo; I think it
literal.&nbsp; David and Alan had every advantage on their side,
position, arms, training, a good conscience; a handful of
merchant sailors, not well led in the first attack, not led at
all in the second, could only by an accident have taken the
roundhouse by attack; and since the defenders had firearms and
food, it is even doubtful if they could have been starved
out.&nbsp; The only doubtful point with me is whether the seamen
would have ever ventured on the second onslaught; I half believe
they would not; still the illusion of numbers and the authority
of Hoseason would perhaps stretch far enough to justify the
extremity.&mdash;I am, dear Mr. Watts, your very sincere
admirer,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Robert Louis
Stevenson</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Watts-Dunton has always been a warm admirer of Stevenson,
of his personal character no less than his undoubted genius, and
Stevenson, on his part, in conversation never failed to speak of
himself, as in this letter he subscribes himself, as Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s sincere admirer.&nbsp; But Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s admiration of Stevenson&rsquo;s work was
more tempered with judgment than was the admiration of some
critics, who afterwards, when he became too successful,
disparaged him.&nbsp; Greatly as he admired
&lsquo;Kidnapped&rsquo; and &lsquo;Catriona,&rsquo; there were
certain of Stevenson&rsquo;s works for which his admiration was
qualified, and certain others for which he had no admiration at
all.&nbsp; His strictures upon the story which seems to have been
at first the main source of Stevenson&rsquo;s popularity,
&lsquo;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,&rsquo; were much resented <a
name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>at the time
by those insincere and fickle worshippers to whom I have already
alluded.&nbsp; Yet these strictures are surely full of wisdom,
and they specially show that wide sweep over the entire field of
literature which is characteristic of all his criticism.&nbsp; As
they contain, besides, one of his many tributes to Scott, I will
quote them here:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Take the little story &lsquo;Dr. Jekyll and
Mr. Hyde,&rsquo; the laudatory criticism upon which is in bulk,
as regards the story itself, like the comet&rsquo;s tail in
relation to the comet.&nbsp; On its appearance as a story, a
&lsquo;shilling shocker&rsquo; for the railway bookstalls, the
critic&rsquo;s attention was directed to its vividness of
narrative and kindred qualities, and though perfectly conscious
of its worthlessness in the world of literary art, he might well
be justified in comparing it to its advantage with other stories
of its class and literary standing.&nbsp; But when it is offered
as a classic&mdash;and this is really how it is offered&mdash;it
has to be judged by critical canons of a very different
kind.&nbsp; It has then to be compared and contrasted with
stories having a like motive&mdash;stories that deal with an idea
as old as the oldest literature&mdash;as old, no doubt, as those
primeval days when man awoke to the consciousness that he is a
moral and a responsible being&mdash;stories whose temper has
always been up to now of the loftiest kind.</p>
<p>It is many years since, in writing of the &lsquo;Parables of
Buddhaghosha,&rsquo; it was our business to treat at length of
the grand idea of man&rsquo;s dual nature, and the many beautiful
forms in which it has been embodied.&nbsp; We said then that,
from the lovely modern story of Ars&egrave;ne Houssaye, where a
young man, starting along life&rsquo;s road, sees on a lawn a
beautiful girl and loves her, and afterwards&mdash;when sin has
soiled him&mdash;finds that she was his own soul, stained <a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>now by his
own sin; and from the still more impressive, though less lovely
modern story of Edgar Poe, &lsquo;William Wilson,&rsquo; up to
the earliest allegories upon the subject, no writer or
story-teller had dared to degrade by gross treatment a motive of
such universal appeal to the great heart of the &lsquo;Great Man,
Mankind.&rsquo;&nbsp; We traced the idea, as far as our knowledge
went, through Calderon, back to Oriental sources, and found, as
we then could truly affirm, that this motive&mdash;from the
ethical point of view the most pathetic and solemn of all
motives&mdash;had been always treated with a nobility and a
greatness that did honour to literary art.&nbsp; Manu, after
telling us that &lsquo;single is each man born into the
world&mdash;single dies,&rsquo; implores each one to
&lsquo;collect virtue,&rsquo; in order that after death he may be
met by the virtuous part of his dual self, a beautiful companion
and guide in traversing &lsquo;that gloom which is so hard to be
traversed.&rsquo;&nbsp; Fine as this is, it is surpassed by an
Arabian story we then quoted (since versified by Sir Edwin
Arnold)&mdash;the story of the wicked king who met after death a
frightful hag for an eternal companion, and found her to be only
a part of his own dual nature, the embodiment of his own evil
deeds.&nbsp; And even this is surpassed by that lovely allegory
in Arda Viraf, in which a virtuous soul in Paradise, walking amid
pleasant trees whose fragrance was wafted from God, meets a part
of his own dual nature, a beautiful maiden, who says to him,
&lsquo;O youth, I am thine own actions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And we instanced other stories and allegories equally
beautiful, in which this supreme thought has been treated as
poetically as it deserves.&nbsp; It was left for Stevenson to
degrade it into a hideous tale of murder and Whitechapel
mystery&mdash;a story of astonishing brutality, in which the
separation of the two natures of the man&rsquo;s soul is effected
not by psychological development, and not by the &lsquo;awful <a
name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>alchemy&rsquo; of the spirit-world beyond the grave, as
in all the previous versions, but by the operation of a dose of
some supposed new drug.</p>
<p>If the whole thing is meant as a horrible joke, in imitation
of De Quincey&rsquo;s &lsquo;Murder considered as One of the Fine
Arts,&rsquo; it tells poorly for Stevenson&rsquo;s sense of
humour.&nbsp; If it is meant as a serious allegory, it is an
outrage upon the grand allegories of the same motive with which
most literatures have been enriched.&nbsp; That a story so coarse
should have met with the plaudits that &lsquo;Dr. Jekyll and Mr.
Hyde&rsquo; met with at the time of its publication&mdash;that it
should now be quoted in leading articles of important papers
every few days, while all the various and beautiful renderings of
the motive are ignored&mdash;what does it mean?&nbsp; Is it a
sign that the &lsquo;shrinkage of the world,&rsquo; the
&lsquo;solidarity of civilisation,&rsquo; making the record of
each day&rsquo;s doings too big for the day, has worked a great
change in our public writers?&nbsp; Is it that they not only have
no time to think, but no time to read anything beyond the
publications of the hour?&nbsp; Is it that good work is unknown
to them, and that bad work is forced upon them, and that in their
busy ignorance they must needs accept it and turn to it for
convenient illustration?&nbsp; That Stevenson should have been
impelled to write the story shows what the &lsquo;Suicide
Club&rsquo; had already shown, that underneath the apparent
health which gives such a charm to &lsquo;Treasure Island&rsquo;
and &lsquo;Kidnapped,&rsquo; there was that morbid strain which
is so often associated with physical disease.</p>
<p>Had it not been for the influence upon him of the healthiest
of all writers since Chaucer&mdash;Walter Scott&mdash;Stevenson
might have been in the ranks of those pompous problem-mongers of
fiction and the stage who do their best to make life
hideous.&nbsp; It must be remembered that <a
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>he was a
critic first and a creator afterwards.&nbsp; He himself tells us
how critically he studied the methods of other writers before he
took to writing himself.&nbsp; No one really understood better
than he Hesiod&rsquo;s fine saying that the muses were born in
order that they might be a forgetfulness of evils and a truce
from cares.&nbsp; No one understood better than he
Joubert&rsquo;s saying, &lsquo;Fiction has no business to exist
unless it is more beautiful than reality; in literature the one
aim is the beautiful; once lose sight of that, and you have the
mere frightful reality.&rsquo;&nbsp; And for the most part he
succeeded in keeping down the morbid impulses of a spirit
imprisoned and fretted in a crazy body.</p>
<p>Save in such great mistakes as &lsquo;Dr. Jekyll and Mr.
Hyde,&rsquo; and a few other stories, Stevenson acted upon
Joubert&rsquo;s excellent maxim.&nbsp; But Scott, and Scott
alone, is always right in this matter&mdash;right by
instinct.&nbsp; He alone is always a delight.&nbsp; If all art is
dedicated to joy, as Schiller declares, and if there is no higher
and more serious problem than how to make men happy, then the
&lsquo;Waverley Novels&rsquo; are among the most precious things
in the literature of the world.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another writer of whose good-nature Mr. Watts-Dunton always
speaks warmly is Browning.&nbsp; Among the many good anecdotes I
have heard him relate in this connection, I will give one.&nbsp;
I do not think that he would object to my doing so.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is one of my misfortunes,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;to be not fully worthy (to use the word of a very dear
friend of mine), of Browning&rsquo;s poetry.&nbsp; Where I am
delighted, stimulated, and exhilarated by the imaginative and
intellectual substance of his work, I find his metrical movements
in a general way not pleasing to my ear.&nbsp; When a <a
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>certain
book of his came out&mdash;I forget which&mdash;it devolved upon
me to review it.&nbsp; Certain eccentricities in it, for some
reason or another, irritated me, and I expressed my irritation in
something very like chaff.&nbsp; A close friend of mine, a
greater admirer of Browning than I am myself&mdash;in fact, Mr.
Swinburne&mdash;chided me for it, and I feel that he was
right.&nbsp; On the afternoon following the appearance of the
article I was at the Royal Academy private view, when Lowell came
up to me and at once began talking about the review.&nbsp;
Lowell, I found, was delighted with it&mdash;said it was the most
original and brilliant thing that had appeared for many
years.&nbsp; &lsquo;But,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a
brave man to be here where Browning always comes.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Then, looking round the room, he said: &lsquo;Why there he is,
and his sister immediately on the side opposite to us.&nbsp;
Surely you will slip away and avoid a meeting!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Slip away!&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;to avoid
Browning!&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know him as well as I do, after
all!&nbsp; Now, let me tell you exactly what will occur if we
stand here for a minute or two.&nbsp; Miss Browning, whose eyes
are looking busily over the room for people that Browning ought
to speak to, in a moment will see you, and in another moment she
will see me.&nbsp; And then you will see her turn her head to
Browning&rsquo;s ear and tell him something.&nbsp; And then
Browning will come straight across to me and be more charming and
cordial than he is in a general way, supposing that be
possible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t believe it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you were not such a Boston Puritan,&rsquo; I said,
&lsquo;I would ask you what will you bet that I am
wrong.&rsquo;</p>
<p>No sooner had I uttered these words than, as I had prophesied,
Miss Browning did spot, first Lowell and then me, and did turn
and whisper in Browning&rsquo;s ear, <a name="page223"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 223</span>and Browning did come straight
across the room to us; and this is what he said, speaking to me
before he spoke to the illustrious American&mdash;a thing which
on any other occasion he would scarcely have done:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re not going to
put me off with generalities any longer.&nbsp; You promised to
write and tell me when you could come to luncheon.&nbsp; You have
never done so&mdash;you will never do so, unless I fix you with a
distinct day.&nbsp; Will you come to-morrow?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall be delighted,&rsquo; I said.&nbsp; And he
turned to Lowell and exchanged a few friendly words with him.</p>
<p>After these two adorable people left us, Lowell said:
&lsquo;Well, this is wonderful.&nbsp; You would have won the
bet.&nbsp; How do you explain it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I explain it by Browning&rsquo;s greatness of soul and
heart.&nbsp; His position is so great, and mine is so small, that
an unappreciative review of a poem of his cannot in the least
degree affect him.&nbsp; But he knows that I am an honest man, as
he has frequently told Tennyson, Jowett, and others.&nbsp; He
wishes to make it quite apparent that he feels no anger towards a
man who says what he thinks about a poem.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After hearing this interesting anecdote I had the curiosity to
turn to the bound volume of my &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; and
read the article on &lsquo;Ferishtah&rsquo;s Fancies,&rsquo;
which I imagine must have been the review in question.&nbsp; This
is what I read:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The poems in this volume can only be
described as parable-poems&mdash;parable-poems, not in the sense
that they are capable of being read as parables (as is said to be
the case with the &lsquo;Rub&aacute;&rsquo;iy&aacute;t&rsquo; of
Omar Khayy&agrave;m), but parable-poems in the sense that they
must be read <a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>as parables, or they show no artistic raison
d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre at all.</p>
<p>Now do our English poets know what it is to write a parable
poem?&nbsp; It is to set self-conscious philosophy singing and
dancing, like the young Gretry, to the tune of a waterfall.&nbsp;
Or rather, it is to imprison the soul of Dinah Morris in the
lissome body of Esmeralda, and set the preacher strumming a
gypsy&rsquo;s tambourine.&nbsp; Though in the pure parable the
intellectual or ethical motive does not dominate so absolutely as
in the case of the pure fable, the form that expresses it, yet it
does, nevertheless, so far govern the form as to interfere with
that entire abandon&mdash;that emotional freedom&mdash;which
seems necessary to the very existence of song.&nbsp; Indeed, if
poetry must, like Wordsworth&rsquo;s ideal John Bull, &lsquo;be
free or die&rsquo;; if she must know no law but that of her own
being (as the doctrine of &lsquo;L&rsquo;art pour
l&rsquo;art&rsquo; declares); if she must not even seem to know
<i>that</i> (as the doctrine of bardic inspiration implies), but
must bend to it apparently in tricksy sport alone&mdash;how can
she&mdash;&lsquo;the singing maid with pictures in her
eyes&rsquo;&mdash;mount the pulpit, read the text, and deliver
the sermon?</p>
<p>In European literature how many parable poems should we find
where the ethical motive and the poetic form are not at deadly
strife?&nbsp; But we discussed all this in speaking of prose
parables, comparing the stories of the Prodigal Son and
Kis&aacute;gotam&iacute; with even such perfect parable poetry as
that of Jami.&nbsp; We said then what we reiterate now: that to
sing a real parable and make it a real song requires a genius of
a very special and peculiar, if somewhat narrow order&mdash;a
genius rare, delicate, ethereal, such as can, according to a
certain Oriental fancy, compete with the Angels of the Water Pot
in floriculture.&nbsp; Mr. Browning, being so fond of Oriental
fancies, and being, moreover, on terms of the closest intimacy <a
name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>with a
certain fancy-weaving dervish, Ferishtah, must be quite familiar
with the Persian story we allude to, the famous story of
&lsquo;Poetry and Cabbages.&rsquo;&nbsp; Still, we will record it
here for a certain learned society.</p>
<p>The earth, says the wise dervish Feridun, was once without
flowers, and men dreamed of nothing more beautiful then than
cabbages.&nbsp; So the Angels of the Water Pot, watering the
T&ucirc;ba Tree (whose fruit becomes flavoured according to the
wishes of the feeder), said one to another, &lsquo;The eyes of
those poor cabbage growers down there may well be horny and dim,
having none of our beautiful things to gaze upon; for as to the
earthly cabbage, though useful in earthly pot, it is in colour
unlovely as ungrateful in perfume; and as to the stars, they are
too far off to be very clearly mirrored in the eyes of folk so
very intent upon cabbages.&rsquo;&nbsp; So the Angels of the
Water Pot, who sit on the rainbow and brew the ambrosial rains,
began fashioning flowers out of the paradisal gems, while Israfel
sang to them; and the words of his song were the mottoes that
adorn the bowers of heaven.&nbsp; So bewitching, however, were
the strains of the singer&mdash;for not only has Israfel a lute
for viscera, but doth he not also, according to the
poet&mdash;</p>
<p>Breathe a stream of otto and balm,<br />
Which through a woof of living music blown<br />
Floats, fused, a warbling rose that makes all senses one?</p>
<p>&mdash;so astonishing were the notes of a singer so furnished,
that the angels at their jewel work could not help tracing his
coloured and perfumed words upon the petals.&nbsp; And this was
how the Angels of the Water Pot made flowers, and this is the
story of &lsquo;Poetry and Cabbages.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the alphabet of the angels, Feridun goes on to declare, is
nothing less than the celestial charactery of <a
name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>heaven, and
is consequently unreadable to all human eyes save a very
few&mdash;that is to say, the eyes of those mortals who are
&lsquo;of the race of Israfel.&rsquo;&nbsp; To common
eyes&mdash;the eyes of the ordinary human
cabbage-grower&mdash;what, indeed, is that angelic caligraphy
with which the petals of the flowers are ornamented?&nbsp;
Nothing but a meaningless maze of beautiful veins and scents and
colours.</p>
<p>But who are &lsquo;of the race of Israfel&rsquo;?&nbsp; Not
the prosemen, certainly, as any Western critic may see who will
refer to Kircher&rsquo;s idle nonsense about the &lsquo;Alphabet
of the Angels&rsquo; in his &lsquo;&AElig;dipus
Egyptiacus.&rsquo;&nbsp; Are they, then, the poets?&nbsp; This is
indeed a solemn query.&nbsp; &lsquo;If,&rsquo; says Feridun,
&lsquo;the mottoes that adorn the bowers of Heaven have been
correctly read by certain Persian poets, who shall be nameless,
what are those other mottoes glowing above the caves of hell in
that fiery alphabet used by the fiends?&rsquo;</p>
<p>One kind of poet only is, it seems, of the race of
Israfel&mdash;the parable-poet&mdash;the poet to whom truth
comes, not in any way as reasoned conclusions, not even as golden
gnomes, but comes symbolized in concrete shapes of vital beauty;
the poet in whose work the poetic form is so part and parcel of
the ethical lesson which vitalizes it that this ethical lesson
seems not to give birth to the music and the colour of the poem,
but to be itself born of the sweet marriage of these, and to be
as inseparable from them as the &lsquo;morning breath&rsquo; of
the Sab&aelig;an rose is inalienable from the innermost
petals&mdash;&lsquo;the subtle odour of the rose&rsquo;s
heart,&rsquo; which no mere chemistry of man, but only the
morning breeze, can steal.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was such writing as this which made it quite superfluous
for Mr. Watts-Dunton to sign his articles, and <a
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>we have
only to contrast it&mdash;or its richness and its
rareness&mdash;with the na&iuml;ve, simple, unadorned style of
&lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; to realize how wide is the range of Mr.
Watts-Dunton as a master of the fine shades of literary
expression.</p>
<h2><a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

THE GREAT BOOK OF WONDER</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">And</span> now begins the most difficult
and the most responsible part of my task&mdash;the selection of
one typical essay from the vast number of essays expressing more
or less fully the great heart-thought which gives life to all Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; I can, of course, give only one,
for already I see signs that this book will swell to proportions
far beyond those originally intended for it.&nbsp; Naturally, I
thought at first that I would select one of the superb articles
on Victor Hugo&rsquo;s works, such for instance as &lsquo;La
Leg&eacute;nde des Si&egrave;cles,&rsquo; or that profound one on
&lsquo;La Religion des Religion.&rsquo;&nbsp; But, after a while,
when I had got the essay typed and ready for inclusion, I changed
my mind.&nbsp; I thought that one of those wonderful essays upon
Oriental subjects which had called forth writings like those of
Sir Edwin Arnold, would serve my purpose better.&nbsp; Finally, I
decided to choose an essay, which when it appeared was so full of
profound learning upon the great book of the world, the Bible,
that it was attributed to almost every great specialist upon the
Bible in Europe and in America.&nbsp; Mr. Watts-Dunton has often
been urged to reprint this essay as a brief text-book for
scholastic use, but he has never done so.&nbsp; It will be noted
by readers of &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; that even so far back as the
publication of this article in the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um &lsquo;,
in 1877, Mr. Watts-Dunton&mdash;to judge from the allusion in it
to &lsquo;Nin-ki-gal, <a name="page229"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 229</span>the Queen of
Death&rsquo;&mdash;seems to have begun to draw upon Philip
Aylwin&rsquo;s &lsquo;Veiled Queen&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There is not, in the whole of modern
history, a more suggestive subject than that of the persistent
attempts of every Western literature to versify the Psalms in its
own idiom, and the uniform failure of these attempts.&nbsp; At
the time that Sternhold was &lsquo;bringing&rsquo; the Psalms
into &lsquo;fine Englysh meter&rsquo; for Henry the Eighth and
Edward the Sixth, continental rhymers were busy at the same kind
of work for their own monarchs&mdash;notably Clement Marot for
Francis the First.&nbsp; And it has been going on ever since,
without a single protest of any importance having been entered
against it.&nbsp; This is astonishing, for the Bible, even from
the point of view of the literary critic, is a sacred book.&nbsp;
Perhaps the time for entering such a protest is come, and a
literary journal may be its proper medium.</p>
<p>A great living savant has characterized the Bible as &lsquo;a
collection of the rude imaginings of Syria,&rsquo; &lsquo;the
worn-out old bottle of Judaism into which the generous new wine
of science is being poured.&rsquo;&nbsp; The great savant was
angry when he said so.&nbsp; The &lsquo;new wine&rsquo; of
science is a generous vintage, undoubtedly, and deserves all the
respect it gets from us; so do those who make it and serve it
out; they have so much intelligence; they are so honest and so
fearless.&nbsp; But whatever may become of their wine in a few
years, when the wine-dealers shall have passed away, when the
savant is forgotten as any star-gazer of Chald&aelig;a,&mdash;the
&lsquo;old bottle&rsquo; is going to be older yet,&mdash;the
Bible is going to be eternal.&nbsp; For that which decides the
vitality of any book is precisely that which decides the value of
any human soul&mdash;not the knowledge it contains, but simply
the attitude it assumes <a name="page230"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 230</span>towards the universe, unseen as well
as seen.&nbsp; The attitude of the Bible is just that which every
soul must, in its highest and truest moods, always
assume&mdash;that of a wise wonder in front of such a universe as
this&mdash;that of a noble humility before a God such as He
&lsquo;in whose great Hand we stand.&rsquo;&nbsp; This is
why&mdash;like Alexander&rsquo;s mirror&mdash;like that most
precious &lsquo;Cup of Jemsh&icirc;d,&rsquo; imagined by the
Persians&mdash;the Bible reflects to-day, and will reflect for
ever, every wave of human emotion, every passing event of human
life&mdash;reflect them as faithfully as it did to the great and
simple people in whose great and simple tongue it was
written.&nbsp; Coming from the Vernunft of Man, it goes straight
to the Vernunft.&nbsp; This is the kind of literature that never
does die: a fact which the world has discovered long ago.&nbsp;
For the Bible is Europe&rsquo;s one book.&nbsp; And with regard
to Asia, as far back as the time of Chrysostom it could have been
read in languages Syrian, Indian, Persian, Armenian, Ethiopic,
Scythian, and Samaritan; now it can be read in every language,
and in almost every dialect, under the sun.</p>
<p>And the very quintessence of the Bible is the Book of the
Psalms.&nbsp; Therefore the Scottish passion for Psalm-singing is
not wonderful; the wonder is that, liking so much to sing, they
can find it possible to sing so badly.&nbsp; It is not wonderful
that the court of Francis I should yearn to sing Psalms; the
wonderful thing is that they should find it in their hearts to
sing Marot&rsquo;s Psalms when they might have sung
David&rsquo;s&mdash;that Her Majesty the Queen could sing to a
fashionable jig, &lsquo;O Lord, rebuke me not in Thine
indignation&rsquo;; and that Anthony, King of Navarre, could sing
to the air of a dance of Poitou, &lsquo;Stand up, O Lord, to
revenge my quarrel.&rsquo;&nbsp; For, although it is given to the
very frogs, says Pascal, to <a name="page231"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 231</span>find music in their own croaking,
the ears that can find music in such frogs as these must be of a
peculiar convolution.</p>
<p>In Psalmody, then, Scottish taste and French are both bad,
from the English point of view; but then the English, having
Hopkins in various incarnations, are fastidious.</p>
<p>When Lord Macaulay&rsquo;s tiresome New Zealander has done
contemplating the ruins of London Bridge, and turned in to the
deserted British Museum to study us through our books&mdash;what
volume can he take as the representative one&mdash;what book,
above all others, can the ghostly librarian select to give him
the truest, the profoundest insight into the character of the
strange people who had made such a great figure in the
earth?&nbsp; We, for our part, should not hesitate to give him
the English Book of Common Prayer, with the authorized version of
the Psalms at the end, as representing the British mind in its
most exalted and its most abject phases.&nbsp; That in the same
volume can be found side by side the beauty and pathos of the
English Litany, the grandeur of the English version of the Psalms
and the effusions of Brady and Tate&mdash;masters of the art of
sinking compared with whom Rous is an inspired bard&mdash;would
be adequate evidence that the Church using it must be a British
Church&mdash;that British, most British, must be the public
tolerating it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;By thine agony and bloody Sweat; by thy Cross and
Passion; by thy Precious Death and Burial; by thy glorious
Resurrection and Ascension; and by the coming of the Holy Ghost,
God Lord, deliver us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Among Western peoples there is but one that could have <a
name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>uttered in
such language this cry, where pathos and sublimity and subtlest
music are so mysteriously blended&mdash;blended so divinely that
the man who can utter it, familiar as it is, without an emotion
deep enough to touch close upon the fount of tears must be
differently constituted from some of us.&nbsp; Among Western
peoples there is, we say, but one that could have done this; for
as M. Taine has well said:&mdash;&lsquo;More than any race in
Europe they (the British) approach by the simplicity and energy
of their conceptions the old Hebraic spirit.&nbsp; Enthusiasm is
their natural condition, and their Deity fills them with
admiration as their ancient deities inspired them with
fury.&rsquo;&nbsp; And now listen to this:&mdash;</p>
<p>When we, our wearied limbs to rest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sat down by proud Euphrates&rsquo; stream,<br />
We wept, with doleful thoughts opprest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Zion was our mournful theme.</p>
<p>Among all the peoples of the earth there is but one that could
have thus degraded the words: &lsquo;By the rivers of Babylon,
there we sat down, yea, we wept when we remembered
Zion.&rsquo;&nbsp; For, to achieve such platitude there is
necessary an element which can only be called the &lsquo;Hopkins
element,&rsquo; an element which is quite an insular birthright
of ours, a characteristic which came over with the &lsquo;White
Horse,&rsquo;&mdash;that &lsquo;dull and greasy coarseness of
taste&rsquo; which distinguishes the British mind from all
others; that &lsquo;&auml;chtbrittische
Beschr&auml;nktheit,&rsquo; which Heine speaks of in his tender
way.&nbsp; The Scottish version is rough, but Brady and
Tate&rsquo;s inanities are worse than Rous&rsquo;s roughness.</p>
<p>Such an anomaly as this in one and the same literature, in one
and the same little book, is unnatural; it is monstrous: whence
can it come?&nbsp; It is, indeed, <a name="page233"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 233</span>singular that no one has ever
dreamed of taking the story of the English Prayer-book, with
Brady and Tate at the end, and using it as a key to unlock that
puzzle of puzzles which has set the Continental critics writing
nonsense about us for generations:&mdash;&lsquo;What is it that
makes the enormous, the fundamental, difference between English
literature&mdash;and all other Western literatures&mdash;Teutonic
no less than Latin or Slavonic?&rsquo;&nbsp; The simple truth of
the matter is, that the British mind has always been bipartite as
now&mdash;has always been, as now, half sublime and half homely
to very coarseness; in other words, it has been half inspired by
David King of Israel, and half by John Hopkins, Suffolk
schoolmaster and archetype of prosaic bards, who, in 1562, took
such of the Psalms as Sternhold had left unsullied and
doggerellized them.&nbsp; For, as we have said, Hopkins, in many
and various incarnations, has been singing unctuously in these
islands ever since the introduction of Christianity, and before;
for he is Anglo-Saxon tastelessness, he is Anglo-Saxon deafness
to music and blindness to beauty.&nbsp; When St. Augustine landed
here with David he found not only Odin, but Hopkins, a heathen
then, in possession of the soil.</p>
<p>There is, therefore, half of a great truth in what M. Taine
says.&nbsp; The English have, besides the Hopkins element, which
is indigenous, much of the Hebraic temper, which is indigenous
too; but they have by nature none of the Hebraic style.&nbsp;
But, somehow, here is the difference between us and the
Continentals; that, though style is born of taste&mdash;though le
style c&rsquo;est la race; and though the Anglo-Saxon started, as
we have seen, with Odin and Hopkins alone; yet, just as instinct
may be sown and grown by ancestral habit of many years&mdash;just
as the pointer puppy, for instance, points, he knows <a
name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span>not why,
because his ancestors were taught to point before him&mdash;so
may the Hebraic style be sown and grown in a foreign soil if the
soil be Anglo-Saxon, and if the seed-time last for a thousand
years.&nbsp; The result of all this is, that the English,
notwithstanding their deficiency of artistic instinct and
coarseness of taste, have the Great Style, not only in poetry,
sometimes, but in prose sometimes when they write emotively, as
we see in the English Prayer-book, in parts of Raleigh&rsquo;s
&lsquo;History of the World,&rsquo; in Jeremy Taylor&rsquo;s
sermons, in Hall&rsquo;s &lsquo;Contemplations,&rsquo; and other
such books of the seventeenth century.</p>
<p>The Great Style is far more easily recognized than
defined.&nbsp; To define any kind of style, indeed, we must turn
to real life.&nbsp; When we say of an individual in real life
that he or she has style, we mean that the individual gives us an
impression of unconscious power or unconscious grace, as
distinguished from that conscious power or conscious grace which
we call manner.&nbsp; The difference is fundamental.&nbsp; It is
the same in literature; style is unconscious power or
grace&mdash;manner is conscious power or grace.&nbsp; But the
Great Style, both in literature and in life, is unconscious power
and unconscious grace in one.</p>
<p>And, whither must we turn in quest of this, as the natural
expression of a national temper?&nbsp; Not to the Celt, we think,
as Mr. Arnold does.&nbsp; Not, indeed, to those whose languages,
complex of syntax and alive with self-conscious inflections,
bespeak the scientific knowingness of the Aryan mind&mdash;not,
certainly, to those who, though producing &AElig;schylus, turned
into Aphrodite the great Astarte of the Syrians, but to the
descendants of Shem,&mdash;the only gentleman among all the sons
of Noah; to those who, yearning always to look straight into the
face of God and live, can see not much else.&nbsp; The Great <a
name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>Style, in a
word, is Semitic.&nbsp; It would be a mistake to call it
Asiatic.&nbsp; For though two of its elements, unconsciousness
and power, are, no doubt, plentiful enough in India, the element
of grace is lacking, for the most part.&nbsp; The Vedic hymns are
both nebulous and unemotive as compared with Semitic hymns, and,
on the other hand, such a high reach of ethical writing as even
that noble and well-known passage from Manu, beginning,
&lsquo;Single is each man born into the world, single he
dies,&rsquo; etc., is quite logical and self-conscious when
compared with the ethical parts of Scripture.&nbsp; The Persians
have the grace always, the power often, but the unconsciousness
almost never.&nbsp; We might perhaps say that there were those in
Egypt once who came near to the great ideal.&nbsp; That
description of the abode of &lsquo;Nin-ki-gal,&rsquo; the Queen
of Death, recently deciphered from a tablet in the British
Museum, is nearly in the Great Style, yet not quite.&nbsp;
Conscious power and conscious grace are Hellenic, of
course.&nbsp; That there is a deal of unconsciousness in Homer is
true; but, put his elaborate comparisons by the side of the fiery
metaphors of the sacred writers, and how artificial he
seems.&nbsp; And note that, afterwards, when he who approached
nearest to the Great Style wrote Prometheus and the Furies,
Orientalism was overflowing Greece, like the waters of the
Nile.&nbsp; It is to the Latin races&mdash;some of
them&mdash;that has filtered Hellenic manner; and whensoever, as
in Dante, the Great Style has been occasionally caught, it comes
not from the Hellenic fountain, but straight from the Hebrew.</p>
<p>What the Latin races lack, the Teutonic races
have&mdash;unconsciousness; often unconscious power; mostly,
however, unconscious brutalit&eacute;.&nbsp; Sublime as is the
Northern mythology, it is vulgar too.&nbsp; The Hopkins
element,&mdash;the dull and stupid homeliness,&mdash;the coarse
<a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
236</span>grotesque, mingle with and mar its finest
effects.&nbsp; Over it all the atmosphere is that of
pantomime&mdash;singing dragons, one-eyed gods, and
Wagner&rsquo;s libretti.&nbsp; Even that great final conflict
between gods and men and the swarming brood of evil on the plain
of Wigrid, foretold by the V&ouml;lu-seeress, when from
Y&ouml;tunland they come and storm the very gates of
Asgard;&mdash;even this fine combat ends in the grotesque and
vulgar picture of the Fenrir-wolf gulping Odin down like an
oyster, and digesting the universe to chaos.&nbsp; But, out of
the twenty-three thousand and more verses into which the Bible
has been divided, no one can find a vulgar verse; for the Great
Style allows the stylist to touch upon any subject with no risk
of defilement.&nbsp; This is why style in literature is
virtue.&nbsp; Like royalty, the Great Style &lsquo;can do no
wrong.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Of Teutonic graceless unconsciousness, the Anglo-Saxons have
by far the largest endowment.&nbsp; They wanted another element,
in short, not the Hellenic element; for there never was a greater
mistake than that of supposing that Hellenism can be engrafted on
Teutonism and live; as Landor and Mr. Matthew Arnold&mdash;two of
the finest and most delicate minds of modern times&mdash;can
testify.</p>
<p>But, long before the memorable Hampton Court Conference; long
before the Bishops&rsquo; Bible or Coverdale&rsquo;s Bible; long
before even Aldhelm&rsquo;s time&mdash;Hebraism had been flowing
over and enriching the Anglo-Saxon mind.&nbsp; From the time when
C&aelig;dmon, the forlorn cow-herd, fell asleep beneath the stars
by the stable-door, and was bidden to sing the Biblical story,
Anglo-Saxon literature grew more and more Hebraic.&nbsp; Yet, in
a certain sense, the Hebraism in which the English mind was
steeped had been Hebraism at second hand&mdash;that of <a
name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span>the Vulgate
mainly&mdash;till Tyndale&rsquo;s time, or rather till the
present Authorized Version of the Bible appeared in 1611.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There is no book,&rsquo; says Selden, &lsquo;so translated
as the Bible for the purpose.&nbsp; If I translate a French book
into English, I turn it into English phrase, not into
French-English.&nbsp; &ldquo;Il fait froid,&rdquo; I say,
&rsquo;tis cold, not it makes cold; but the Bible is rather
translated into English words than into English phrase, The
Hebraisms are kept, and the phrase of that language is
kept.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And in great measure this is true, no doubt; yet literal
accuracy&mdash;importation of Hebraisms&mdash;was not of itself
enough to produce a translation in the Great Style&mdash;a
translation such as this, which, as Coleridge says, makes us
think that &lsquo;the translators themselves were
inspired.&rsquo;&nbsp; To reproduce the Great Style of the
original in a Western idiom, the happiest combination of
circumstances was necessary.&nbsp; The temper of the people
receiving must, notwithstanding all differences of habitation and
civilization, be elementally in harmony with that of the people
giving; that is, it must be poetic rather than
ratiocinative.&nbsp; Society must not be too complex&mdash;its
tone must not be too knowing and self-glorifying.&nbsp; The
accepted psychology of the time must not be the psychology of the
scalpel&mdash;the metaphysics must not be the metaphysics of
newspaper cynicism; above all, enthusiasm and vulgarity must not
be considered synonymous terms.&nbsp; Briefly, the tone of the
time must be free of the faintest suspicion of nineteenth century
flavour.&nbsp; That this is the kind of national temper necessary
to such a work might have been demonstrated by an argument a
priori.&nbsp; It was the temper of the English nation when the
Bible was translated.&nbsp; That noble heroism&mdash;born of
faith in God and belief in the high duties of man&mdash;which we
have lost for the hour&mdash;<a name="page238"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 238</span>was in the very atmosphere that hung
over the island.&nbsp; And style in real life, which now, as a
consequence of our loss, does not exist at all among Englishmen,
and only among a very few Englishwomen&mdash;having given place
in all classes to manner&mdash;flourished then in all its
charm.&nbsp; And in literature it was the same: not even the
euphuism imported from Spain could really destroy or even
seriously damage the then national sense of style.</p>
<p>Then, as to the form of literature adopted in the translation,
what must that be?&nbsp; Evidently it must be some kind of form
which can do all the high work that is generally left to metrical
language, and yet must be free from any soup&ccedil;on of that
&lsquo;artifice,&rsquo; in the &lsquo;abandonment&rsquo; of
which, says an Arabian historian, &lsquo;true art alone
lies.&rsquo;&nbsp; For, this is most noteworthy, that of
literature as an art, the Semites show but small conception, even
in Job.&nbsp; It was too sacred for that&mdash;drama and epic in
the Aryan sense were alike unknown.</p>
<p>But if the translation must not be metrical in the common
acceptation of that word, neither must it be prose; we will not
say logical prose; for all prose, however high may be its
flights, however poetic and emotive, must always be logical
underneath, must always be chained by a logical chain, and
earth-bound like a captive balloon; just as poetry, on the other
hand, however didactic and even ratiocinative it may become, must
always be steeped in emotion.&nbsp; It must be neither verse nor
prose, it seems.&nbsp; It must be a new movement
altogether.&nbsp; The musical movement of the English Bible is a
new movement; let us call it &lsquo;Bible Rhythm.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And the movement was devised thus: Difficulty is the worker of
modern miracles.&nbsp; Thanks to Difficulty&mdash;thanks to the
conflict between what Selden calls &lsquo;Hebrew phrase and
English phrase,&rsquo; the translators fashioned, or rather, <a
name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>Difficulty
fashioned for them, a movement which was neither one nor wholly
the other&mdash;a movement which, for music, for variety,
splendour, sublimity, and pathos, is above all the effects of
English poetic art, above all the rhythms and all the rhymes of
the modern world&mdash;a movement, indeed, which is a form of art
of itself&mdash;but a form in which &lsquo;artifice&rsquo; is
really &lsquo;abandoned&rsquo; at last.&nbsp; This rhythm it is
to which we referred as running through the English Prayer-book,
and which governs every verse of the Bible, its highest reaches
perhaps being in the Psalms&mdash;this rhythm it is which the
Hopkinses and Rouses have&mdash;improved!&nbsp; It would not be
well to be too technical here, yet the matter is of the greatest
literary importance just now, and it is necessary to explain
clearly what we mean.</p>
<p>Among the many delights which we get from the mere form of
what is technically called Poetry, the chief, perhaps, is
expectation and the fulfilment of expectation.&nbsp; In rhymed
verse this is obvious: having familiarized ourselves with the
arrangement of the poet&rsquo;s rhymes, we take pleasure in
expecting a recurrence of these rhymes according to this
arrangement.&nbsp; In blank verse the law of expectation is less
apparent.&nbsp; Yet it is none the less operative.&nbsp; Having
familiarized ourselves with the poet&rsquo;s rhythm, having found
that iambic foot succeeds iambic foot, and that whenever the
iambic waves have begun to grow monotonous, variations
occur&mdash;trochaic, anap&aelig;stic, dactylic&mdash;according
to the law which governs the ear of this individual
poet;&mdash;we, half consciously, expect at certain intervals
these variations, and are delighted when our expectations are
fulfilled.&nbsp; And our delight is augmented if also our
expectations with regard to c&aelig;suric effects are realized in
the same proportions.&nbsp; Having, for instance, learned, half
unconsciously, that the poet has <a name="page240"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 240</span>an ear for a particular kind of
pause; that he delights, let us say, to throw his pause after the
third foot of the sequence,&mdash;we expect that, whatever may be
the arrangement of the early pauses with regard to the initial
foot of any sequence,&mdash;there must be, not far ahead, that
climacteric third-foot pause up to which all the other pauses
have been tending, and upon which the ear and the soul of the
reader shall be allowed to rest to take breath for future
flights.&nbsp; And when this expectation of c&aelig;suric effects
is thus gratified, or gratified in a more subtle way, by an
arrangement of earlier semi-pauses, which obviates the necessity
of the too frequent recurrence of this final third-foot pause,
the full pleasure of poetic effects is the result.&nbsp; In other
words, a large proportion of the pleasure we derive from poetry
is in the recognition of law.&nbsp; The more obvious and
formulated is the law,&mdash;nay, the more arbitrary and
Draconian,&mdash;the more pleasure it gives to the uncultivated
ear.&nbsp; This is why uneducated people may delight in rhyme,
and yet have no ear at all for blank verse; this is why the
savage, who has not even an ear for rhyme, takes pleasure in such
unmistakable rhythm as that of his tom-tom.&nbsp; But, as the ear
becomes more cultivated, it demands that these indications of law
should be more and more subtle, till at last recognized law
itself may become a tyranny and a burden.&nbsp; He who will read
Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays chronologically, as far as that is
practicable, from &lsquo;Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s Lost&rsquo;
to the &lsquo;Tempest,&rsquo; will have no difficulty in seeing
precisely what we mean.&nbsp; In literature, as in social life,
the progress is from lawless freedom, through tyranny, to freedom
that is lawful.&nbsp; Now the great features of Bible Rhythm are
a recognized music apart from a recognized
law&mdash;&lsquo;artifice&rsquo; so completely abandoned that we
forget we are in the realm of art&mdash;pauses so divinely set
that <a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
241</span>they seem to be &lsquo;wood-notes wild,&rsquo; though
all the while they are, and must be, governed by a mysterious law
too subtly sweet to be formulated; and all kind of beauties
infinitely beyond the triumphs of the metricist, but beauties
that are unexpected.&nbsp; There is a metre, to be sure, but it
is that of the &lsquo;moving music which is life&rsquo;; it is
the living metre of the surging sea within the soul of him who
speaks; it is the free effluence of the emotions and the passions
which are passing into the words.&nbsp; And if this is so in
other parts of the Bible, what is it in the Psalms, where
&lsquo;the flaming steeds of song,&rsquo; though really kept
strongly in hand, seem to run reinless as &lsquo;the wild horses
of the wind&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

A HUMOURIST UPON HUMOUR</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> reaching of a decision as to
what article to select as typical of what I may call &lsquo;The
Renascence of Wonder&rsquo; essays gave me so much trouble that
when I came to the still more difficult task of selecting an
essay typical of Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s criticism dealing with
what he calls &lsquo;the laws of cause and effect in literary
art&rsquo; it naturally occurred to me to write to him asking for
a suggestive hint or two.&nbsp; In response to my letter I got a
thoroughly characteristic reply, in which his affection for a
friend took entire precedence of his own work:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Mr.
Douglas</span>,&mdash;The selections from my critiques must
really be left entirely to yourself.&nbsp; They are to illustrate
your own critical judgment upon my work, and not mine.&nbsp;
Overwhelmed as I am with avocations which I daresay you little
dream of, for me to plunge into the countless columns of the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um,&rsquo; in quest of articles of mine which
I have quite forgotten, would be an intolerable burden at the
present moment.&nbsp; I can think of only one article which I
should specially like reproduced, either in its entirety or in
part&mdash;not on account of any merit in it which I can recall,
but because it was the means of bringing me into contact with one
of the most delightful men and one of the most splendidly <a
name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>equipped
writers of our time, whose sudden death shocked and grieved me
beyond measure.&nbsp; A few days after the article appeared, the
then editor of the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um,&rsquo; Mr. MacColl, the
dear friend with whom I was associated for more than twenty
years, showed me a letter that he had received from Traill.&nbsp;
It was an extremely kind letter.&nbsp; Among the many generous
things that Traill said was this&mdash;that it was just the kind
of review article which makes the author regret that he had not
seen it before his book appeared.&nbsp; I wrote to Traill in
acknowledgment of his kind words; but it was not until a good
while after this that we met at the Incorporated Authors&rsquo;
Society dinner.&nbsp; At the table where I was sitting, and
immediately opposite me, sat a gentleman whose countenance,
especially when it was illuminated by conversation with his
friends, perfectly charmed me.&nbsp; Although there was not the
smallest regularity in his features, the expression was so genial
and so winsome that I had some difficulty in persuading myself
that it was not a beautiful face after all, and his smile was
really quite irresistible.&nbsp; The contrast between his black
eyebrows and whiskers and the white hair upon his head gave him a
peculiarly picturesque appearance.&nbsp; Another thing I noticed
was a boyish kind of lisp, which somehow, I could not say why,
gave to the man an added charm.&nbsp; I did not know it was
Traill, but after the dinner was over, when I was saying to
myself, &lsquo;That is a man I should like to know,&rsquo; a
friend who sat next him&mdash;I forget who it was&mdash;brought
him round to me and introduced him as &lsquo;Mr.
Traill.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;You and I ought to know each
other,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;for, besides having many tastes in
common, we live near each other.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then I found
that he lived near the &lsquo;Northumberland Arms,&rsquo; between
<a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>Putney
and Barnes.&nbsp; I think that he must have seen how greatly I
was drawn to him, for he called at The Pines in a few
days&mdash;I think, indeed, it was the very next day&mdash;and
then began a friendship the memory of which gives me intense
pleasure, and yet pleasure not unmixed with pain, when I recall
his comparatively early and sudden death.&nbsp; I used to go to
his gatherings, and it was there that I first met several
interesting men that I had not known before.&nbsp; One of them, I
remember, was Mr. Sidney Low, then the editor of the &lsquo;St.
James&rsquo;s Gazette.&rsquo;&nbsp; And I also used to meet there
interesting men whom I had known before, such as the late Sir
Edwin Arnold, whose &lsquo;Light of Asia,&rsquo; and other such
works, I had reviewed in the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um.&rsquo;&nbsp;
I do not hesitate for a moment to say that Traill was a man of
genius.&nbsp; Had he lived fifty years earlier, such a writer as
he who wrote &lsquo;The New Lucian,&rsquo; &lsquo;Recaptured
Rhymes,&rsquo; &lsquo;Saturday Songs,&rsquo; &lsquo;The
Canaanitish Press&rsquo; and &lsquo;Israelitish Questions,&rsquo;
&lsquo;the Life of Sterne,&rsquo; and the brilliant articles in
the &lsquo;Saturday Review&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Pall Mall
Gazette,&rsquo; would have made an unforgettable mark in
literature.&nbsp; But there is no room for anybody now&mdash;no
room for anybody but the very, very few.&nbsp; When he was about
starting &lsquo;Literature,&rsquo; he wrote to me, and a
gratifying letter it was.&nbsp; He said that, although he had no
desire to wean me from the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um,&rsquo; he
should be delighted to receive anything from me when I chanced to
be able to spare him something.&nbsp; It was always an aspiration
of mine to send something to a paper edited by so important a
literary figure&mdash;a paper, let me say, that had a finer,
sweeter tone than any other paper of my time&mdash;I mean, that
tone of fine geniality upon which I have often commented, that
tone without which, &lsquo;there can be no true
criticism.&rsquo;&nbsp; A certain <a name="page245"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 245</span>statesman of our own period, who had
pursued literature with success, used to say (alluding to a paper
of a very different kind, now dead), that the besetting sin of
the literary class is that lack of gentlemanlike feeling one
towards another which is to be seen in all the other educated
classes.&nbsp; This might have been so then, but, through the
influence mainly of &lsquo;Literature&rsquo; and H. D. Traill, it
is not so now.&nbsp; Many people have speculated as to why a
literary journal, edited by such a man, and borne into the
literary arena on the doughty back of the &lsquo;Times,&rsquo;
did not succeed.&nbsp; I have a theory of my own upon that
subject.&nbsp; Although Traill&rsquo;s hands were so full of all
kinds of journalistic and magazine work in other quarters, it is
a mistake to suppose that his own journal was badly edited.&nbsp;
It was well edited, and it had a splendid staff, but several
things were against it.&nbsp; It confined itself to literature,
and did not, as far as I remember, give its attention to much
else.&nbsp; Its price was sixpence; but its chief cause of
failure was what I may call its &lsquo;personal
appearance.&rsquo;&nbsp; If personal appearance is an enormously
powerful factor at the beginning of the great human struggle for
life, it is at the first quite as important a factor in the life
struggle of a newspaper or a magazine.&nbsp; When the
&lsquo;Saturday Review&rsquo; was started, its personal
appearance&mdash;something quite new then&mdash;did almost as
much for it as the brilliant writing.&nbsp; It was the same with
the &lsquo;Pall Mall Gazette&rsquo; when it started.&nbsp;
Carlyle was quite right in thinking that there is a great deal in
clothes.&nbsp; Now, as I told Traill when we were talking about
this, &lsquo;Literature&rsquo; in appearance seemed an uninviting
cross between the &lsquo;Law Times&rsquo; and &lsquo;The
Lancet&rsquo;&mdash;it seemed difficult to connect the
unbusiness-like genius of literature with such a <a
name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
246</span>business-like looking sheet as that.&nbsp; Traill
laughed, but ended by saying that he believed there was a great
deal in that notion of mine.&nbsp; Some one was telling me the
other day that Traill, who died only about four years ago, was
beginning to be forgotten.&nbsp; I should be sorry indeed to
think that.&nbsp; All that I can say is that for a book such as
yours to be written about me, and no book to be written about
Traill, presents itself to my mind as being as grotesque an idea
as any that Traill&rsquo;s own delightful whimsical imagination
could have pictured.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course I comply with Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s wishes, and I
do this with the more alacrity because there is this connection
between the essay on Sterne and the imaginative work&mdash;the
theory of absolute humour exemplified in Mrs. Gudgeon is very
brilliantly expounded in the article.&nbsp; It was a review of
Traill&rsquo;s &lsquo;Sterne,&rsquo; in the &lsquo;English Men of
Letters,&rsquo; and it appeared in the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; of November 18, 1882.&nbsp; I will
quote the greater part of it:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Contemporary humour, for the most part,
even among cultivated writers, is in temper either cockney or
Yankee, and both Sterne and Cervantes are necessarily more talked
about than studied, while Addison as a humorist is not even
talked about.&nbsp; In gauging the quality of poetry&mdash;in
finding for any poet his proper place in the poetic
heavens&mdash;there is always uncertainty and difficulty.&nbsp;
With humour, however, this difficulty does not exist, if we bear
steadily in mind that all humour is based upon a simple sense of
incongruous relations, and that the quality of every man&rsquo;s
humour depends upon the kind of incongruity which he recognizes
and finds laughable.&nbsp; If, for instance, he shows himself to
<a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>have no
sense of any incongruities deeper than those disclosed by the
parodist and the punster, his relation to the real humourist and
the real wit is that of a monkey to a man; for although the real
humourist may descend to parody, and the real wit may descend to
punning, as Aristophanes did, the pun and the parody are charged
with some deeper and richer intent.&nbsp; Again, if a man&rsquo;s
sense of humour, like that of the painter of society, is confined
to a sense of the incongruous relations existing between
individual eccentricity and the social conventions by which it is
surrounded, he may be a humourist no doubt&mdash;according, at
least, to the general acceptation of that word, though a
caricaturist according to a definition of humour and caricature
which we once ventured upon in these columns; but his humour is
jejune, and delightful to the Philistine only.&nbsp; If, like
that of Cervantes and (in a lower degree) Fielding, Thackeray,
and Dickens, a writer&rsquo;s sense of the incongruous is deeper
than this, but is confined nevertheless to what Mr. Traill calls
&lsquo;the irony of human intercourse,&rsquo; he is indeed a
humourist, and in the case of Cervantes a very great humourist,
yet not necessarily of the greatest; for just as the greatest
poet must have a sense of the highest and deepest harmonies
possible for the soul of man to apprehend, so the greatest
humourist must have a sense of the highest and deepest
incongruities possible.&nbsp; And it will be found that these
harmonies and these incongruities lie between the very
&lsquo;order of the universe&rsquo; itself and the mind of
man.&nbsp; In certain temperaments the eternal incongruities
between man&rsquo;s mind and the scheme of the universe produce,
no doubt, the pessimism of Schopenhauer and Novalis; but to other
temperaments&mdash;to a Rabelais or Sterne, for
instance&mdash;the apprehension of them turns the cosmos into
disorder, turns <a name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
248</span>it into something like that boisterous joke which to
most temperaments is only possible under the excitement of some
&lsquo;paradis artificiel.&rsquo;&nbsp; Great as may be the
humourist whose sense of irony is that of &lsquo;human
intercourse,&rsquo; if he has no sense of this much deeper
irony&mdash;the irony of man&rsquo;s intercourse with the
universal harmony itself&mdash;he cannot be ranked with the very
greatest.&nbsp; Of this irony in the order of things Aristophanes
and Rabelais had an instinctive, while Richter had an
intellectual enjoyment.&nbsp; Of Swift and Carlyle it might be
said that they had not so much an enjoyment as a terrible
apprehension of it.&nbsp; And if we should find that this quality
exists in &lsquo;Tristram Shandy,&rsquo; how high, then, must we
not place Sterne!&nbsp; And if we should find that Cervantes
deals with the &lsquo;irony of human intercourse&rsquo; merely,
and that his humour is, with all its profundity, terrene, what
right have critics to set Cervantes above Sterne?&nbsp; Why is
the sense of incongruity upon which the humour of Cervantes is
based so melancholy?&nbsp; Because it only sees the farce from
the human point of view.&nbsp; The sad smile of Cervantes is the
tearful humour of a soul deeply conscious of man&rsquo;s
ludicrous futility in his relations to his fellow-man.&nbsp; But
while the futilities of &lsquo;Don Quixote&rsquo; are tragic
because terrene, the futilities of &lsquo;Tristram Shandy&rsquo;
are comic because they are derived from the order of
things.&nbsp; It is the great humourist Circumstance who causes
Mrs. Shandy to think of the clock at the most inopportune moment,
and who, stooping down from above the constellations, interferes
to flatten Tristram&rsquo;s nose.&nbsp; And if Circumstance
proves to be so fond of fun, he must be found in the end a
benevolent king; and hence all is well.</p>
<p>While, however, it is, as we say, easy in a general way to
gauge a humourist and find his proper place, it <a
name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>is not easy
to bring Sterne under a classification.&nbsp; In Sterne&rsquo;s
writings every kind of humour is to be found, from a style of
farce which even at Crazy Castle must have been pronounced too
wild, up to humour as chaste and urbane as Addison&rsquo;s, and
as profound and dramatic as Shakespeare&rsquo;s.&nbsp; In loving
sympathy with stupidity, for instance, even Shakespeare is
outdone by Sterne in his &lsquo;fat, foolish
scullion.&rsquo;&nbsp; Lower than the Dogberry type there is a
type of humanity made up of animal functions merely, to whom the
mere fact of being alive is the one great triumph.&nbsp; While
the news of Bobby&rsquo;s death, announced by Obadiah in the
kitchen, suggests to Susannah the various acquisitions to herself
that must follow such a sad calamity to the &lsquo;fat, foolish
scullion,&rsquo; scrubbing her pans on the floor, it merely
recalls the great triumphant fact of her own life, and
consequently to the wail that &lsquo;Bobby is certainly
dead&rsquo; her soul merely answers as she scrubs, &lsquo;So am
not I.&rsquo;&nbsp; In four words that scullion lives for
ever.</p>
<p>Sterne&rsquo;s humour, in short, is Shakespearean and
Rabelaisian, Cervantic and Addisonian too; how, then, shall we
find a place for such a Proteus?&nbsp; So great is the plasticity
of genius, so readily at first does it answer to impressions from
without, that in criticizing its work it is always necessary
carefully to pierce through the method and seek the essential
life by force of which methods can work.&nbsp; Sterne having, as
a student of humourous literature, enjoyed the mirthful abandon
of Rabelais no less than the pensive irony of Cervantes, it was
inevitable that his methods should oscillate between that of
Rabelais on the one hand, and that of Cervantes on the other, and
that at first this would be so without Sterne&rsquo;s natural
endowment of humour being necessarily either Rabelaisian or
Cervantic, that is to say, <a name="page250"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 250</span>either lyric or dramatic, either the
humour of animal mirth or the humour of philosophic
meditation.&nbsp; But the more deeply we pierce underneath his
methods, the more certainly shall we find that he was by nature
the very Proteus of humour which he pretended to be.&nbsp; And
after all this is the important question as regards Sterne.&nbsp;
Lamb&rsquo;s critical acuteness is nowhere more clearly seen than
in that sentence where he speaks of his own &lsquo;self-pleasing
quaintness.&rsquo;&nbsp; When any form of art departs in any way
from symmetrical and normal lines, the first question to ask
concerning it is this: Is it self-pleasing or is it artificial
and histrionic?&nbsp; That which pleases the producer may perhaps
not please us; but if we feel that it does not really and truly
please the artist himself, the artist becomes a mountebank, and
we turn away in disgust.&nbsp; In the humourous portions of
Sterne&rsquo;s work there is, probably, not a page, however
nonsensical, which he did not write with gusto, and therefore,
bad as some of it may be, it is not to the true critic an
offence. . . .</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yorickism&rsquo; is, there is scarcely need to say, the
very opposite of the humour of Swift.&nbsp; One recognizes that
the universe is rich in things to laugh at and to love; the other
recognizes that the universe is rich in things to laugh at and to
hate.&nbsp; One recognizes that among these absurd things there
is nothing else so absurd and (because so absurd) so lovable as a
man; the other recognizes that there is nothing else so absurd
and (because so absurd) so hateful as a man.&nbsp; The
intellectual process is the same; the difference lies in the
temperament&mdash;the temperament of Jaques and the temperament
of Apemantus.&nbsp; And in regard to misanthropic ridicule it is
difficult to say which fate is more terrible, Swift&rsquo;s or
Carlyle&rsquo;s&mdash;that of the man whose heart must needs <a
name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>yearn
towards a race which his piercing intellect bids him hate, or
that of the man, religious, conscientious, and good, who would
fain love his fellows and cannot.&nbsp; It is idle for men of
this kind to try to work in the vein of Yorick.&nbsp; It needs
the sweet temper of him who at the Mermaid kept the table in a
roar, or of him who, in the words of the &lsquo;cadet of the
house of Keppoch,&rsquo; was &lsquo;sometimes called Tristram
Shandy and sometimes Yorick, a very great favourite of the
gentlemen.&rsquo;&nbsp; Sterne, like Jaques and Hamlet, deals
with &lsquo;the irony of human intercourse,&rsquo; but what he
specially recognizes is a deeper irony still&mdash;the irony of
man&rsquo;s intercourse with himself and with nature, the irony
of the intercourse between man the spiritual being and man the
physical being&mdash;the irony, in short, of man&rsquo;s position
amid these natural conditions of life and death.&nbsp; It is in
the apprehension of this anomaly&mdash;a spiritual nature
enclosed in a physical nature&mdash;that Sterne&rsquo;s strength
lies.</p>
<p>Man, the &lsquo;fool of nature,&rsquo; prouder than Lucifer
himself, yet &lsquo;bounded in a nutshell,&rsquo; brother to the
panniered donkey, and held of no more account by the winds and
rains of heaven than the poor little &lsquo;beastie&rsquo; whose
house is ruined by the ploughshare&mdash;here is, indeed, a
creature for Swift and Carlyle and Sterne and Burns to marvel at
and to laugh at, but with what different kinds of laughter!&nbsp;
There is nothing incongruous in the condition of the lower
animals, because they are in entire harmony with their natural
surroundings; there is nothing more absurd in the existence and
the natural functions of a horse or a cow than in the existence
and the natural functions of the grass upon which they feed; but
imagine a spiritual being so placed, so surrounded, and so
functioned, and you get an absurdity compared with which all
other absurdities are <a name="page252"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 252</span>non-existent, or, at least, are fit
quarry for the satirist, but hardly for the humourist.&nbsp; That
Sterne&rsquo;s donkey should owe his existence to the exercise of
certain natural functions on the part of his unconscious
progenitors, that he should continue to hold his place by the
exercise on his own part of certain other natural functions, is
in no way absurd, and contains in it no material for humoristic
treatment.&nbsp; To render him absurd you must bring him into
relation with man; you must clap upon his back panniers of human
devising or give him macaroons kneaded by a human cook.&nbsp;
Then to the general observer he becomes absurd, for he is tried
by human standards.&nbsp; But to Yorick it is not so much the
donkey who is absurd as the fantastic creature who made the
panniers and cooked the macaroons.&nbsp; All other humour is thin
compared with this.&nbsp; Besides, it never grows old.&nbsp; It
is difficult, no doubt, to think that the humour of Cervantes
will ever lose its freshness; but the kind of humour we have
called Yorickism will be immortal, for no advance in human
knowledge can dim its lustre.&nbsp; Certainly up to the present
moment the anomaly of man&rsquo;s position upon the planet is not
lessened by the revelations of science as to his origin and
development.&nbsp; On the contrary, it is increased, as we hinted
in speaking of Thoreau.&nbsp; If man was a strange and anomalous
&lsquo;piece of work&rsquo; as Hamlet knew him under the old
cosmogony, what a &lsquo;piece of work&rsquo; does he appear
now!&nbsp; He has the knack of advancing and leaving the
woodchucks behind, but how has he done it?&nbsp; By the fact of
his being the only creature out of harmony with surrounding
conditions.&nbsp; A contented conservatism is the primary
instinct of the entire animal kingdom, and if any species should
change, it is not (as Lamarck once supposed) from any
&lsquo;inner yearning&rsquo; for progress, but <a
name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 253</span>because it
was pushed on by overmastering circumstances.&nbsp; An ungulate
becomes the giraffe, not because it is uncomfortable in its old
condition and yearns for giraffe-hood, but because, being driven
from grass to leaves by natural causes, it must elongate its neck
or starve.&nbsp; But man really has this yearning for progress,
and, because he is out of harmony with everything, he advances
till at last he turns all the other creatures into food or else
into weight-carriers, and outstrips them so completely that he
forgets he is one of them.&nbsp; If Uncle Toby&rsquo;s
progenitors were once as low down in the scale of life as the fly
that buzzed about his nose, the fly had certainly more right to
buzz than had that over-developed, incongruous creature, Captain
Shandy, to be disturbed at its buzzing, and the patronizing
speech of the captain as he opens the window gains an added
humour, for it is the fly that should patronize and take pity
upon the man.</p>
<p>And while Sterne&rsquo;s abiding sense of the struggle between
man&rsquo;s spiritual nature and the conditions of his physical
nature accounts for the metaphysical depth of some of his humour,
it greatly accounts for his indecencies too.&nbsp; Sterne had
that instinct for idealizing women, and the entire relations
between the sexes which accompanies the poetic temperament.&nbsp;
To such natures the spiritual side of sexual relations is ever
present; and as a consequence of this the animal side never loses
with them the atmosphere of wonder with which it was enveloped in
their boyish days.&nbsp; Not that we are going to justify
Sterne&rsquo;s indecencies.&nbsp; Coleridge&rsquo;s remark that
the pleasure Sterne got from his double entendre was akin to
&lsquo;that trembling daring with which a child touches a hot
teapot because it has been forbidden,&rsquo; partly explains, but
it does not excuse, Sterne&rsquo;s transgressions <a
name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
254</span>herein.&nbsp; The fact seems to be that if we divide
love into the passion of love, the sentiment of love, and the
appetite of love, and inquire which of these was really known to
Sterne, we shall come to what will seem to most readers the
paradoxical conclusion that it was the sentiment only.&nbsp;
There is abundant proof of this.&nbsp; In the &lsquo;Letter to
the Earl of &mdash;,&rsquo; printed by his daughter, after
dilating upon the manner in which the writing of the
&lsquo;Sentimental Journey&rsquo; has worn out both his spirits
and body, he says: &lsquo;I might indeed solace myself with my
wife (who is come to France), but, in fact, I have long been a
sentimental being, whatever your lordship may think to the
contrary.&nbsp; The world has imagined because I wrote
&ldquo;Tristram Shandy&rdquo; that I was myself more Shandian
than I really ever was.&rsquo;&nbsp; Upon this passage Mr. Traill
has the pertinent remark: &lsquo;The connubial affections are
here, in all seriousness and good faith apparently, opposed to
the sentimental emotions&mdash;as the lower to the higher.&nbsp;
To indulge the former is to be &ldquo;Shandian,&rdquo; that is to
say, coarse and carnal; to devote oneself to the latter, or, in
other words, to spend one&rsquo;s days in semi-erotic
languishings over the whole female sex indiscriminately, is to
show spirituality and taste.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now, to men of this
kind there is not uncommonly, perhaps, a charm in a licentious
double entendre which is quite inscrutable to those of a more
animal temperament.&nbsp; The incongruity between the ideal and
the actual relations brings poignant distress at first, and
afterwards a sense of irresistible absurdity.&nbsp; Originally
the fascination of repulsion, it becomes the fascination of
attraction, and it is not at all fanciful to say that in Uncle
Toby and the Widow Wadman, Sterne (quite unconsciously to himself
perhaps) realized to his own mind those two <a
name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>opposite
sides of man&rsquo;s nature whose conflict in some form or
another was ever present to Sterne&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; And, as we
say, it has a deep relation to the kind of humour with which
Sterne was so richly endowed.&nbsp; After one of his most
sentimental flights, wherein the spiritual side of man is
absurdly exaggerated, there comes upon him a sudden revulsion
(which at first was entirely natural, if even self-conscious
afterwards).&nbsp; The incongruity of all this sentiment with
man&rsquo;s actual condition as an animal strikes him with
irresistible force, and he says to man, &lsquo;What right have
you in that galley after all&mdash;you who came into the world in
this extremely unspiritual fashion and keep in it by the agency
of functions which are if possible more unspiritual and more
absurd still?&rsquo;</p>
<p>No doubt the universal sense of shame in connection with
sexual matters, which Hartley has discussed in his subtle but
rather far-fetched fashion, arises from an acute apprehension of
this great and eternal incongruity of man&rsquo;s
existence&mdash;the conflict of a spiritual nature and such
aspirations as man&rsquo;s with conditions entirely
physical.&nbsp; And perhaps the only truly philosophical
definition of the word &lsquo;indecency&rsquo; would be this:
&lsquo;A painful and shocking contrast of man&rsquo;s spiritual
with his physical nature.&rsquo;&nbsp; When Hamlet, with his
finger on Yorick&rsquo;s skull, declares that his &lsquo;gorge
rises at it,&rsquo; and asks if Alexander&rsquo;s skull
&lsquo;smelt so,&rsquo; he shocks us as deeply in a serious way
as Sterne in his allusion to the winding up of the clock shocks
us in a humourous way, and to express the sensation they each
give there is, perhaps, no word but
&lsquo;indecent.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have now cited the opinions of Mr. Watts-Dunton upon the
metaphysical meaning of humour.&nbsp; In order to show what are
his opinions upon wit, I think I shall do well to turn from the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; articles, and to quote from <a
name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>the
&lsquo;Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica&rsquo; a few sentences upon
wit, and upon the distinction between comedy and farce.&nbsp; For
the obvious reason that the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; articles
are buried in oblivion, and the &lsquo;Encyclop&aelig;dia
Britannica&rsquo; articles are certainly not so deeply buried, it
is from the former that I have been mainly quoting; but some of
the most important parts of Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s work are to
be found in the &lsquo;Encyclop&aelig;dia
Britannica.&rsquo;&nbsp; Perhaps, however, I had better introduce
my citations by saying a few words about Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s
connection with that work.</p>
<p>The story of the way in which he came to write in the
&lsquo;Encyclop&aelig;dia&rsquo; has been often told by Prof.
Minto.&nbsp; At the time when the ninth edition was started, he
and Mr. Watts-Dunton were living in adjoining chambers and were
seeing each other constantly.&nbsp; When Minto was writing his
articles upon Byron and Dickens, he told Mr. Watts-Dunton that
Baynes would be delighted to get work from him.&nbsp; But at that
time Mr. Watts-Dunton had got more critical work in hand than he
wanted, and besides he had already a novel and a body of poetry
ready for the press, and wished to confine his energies to
creative work.&nbsp; Besides this, he felt, as he declared, that
he could not do the work fitted for the compact, businesslike
pedestrian style of an encyclop&aelig;dia.&nbsp; But when the
most important treatise in the literary department of the
work&mdash;the treatise on Poetry&mdash;was wanted, a peculiar
difficulty in selecting the writer was felt.&nbsp; The article in
the previous edition had been written by David Macbeth Moir,
famous under the name of &lsquo;Delta&rsquo; as the author of
&lsquo;The Autobiography of Mansie Wauch.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Moir&rsquo;s article was intelligent enough, but quite inadequate
to such a work as the publishers of <a name="page257"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 257</span>the &lsquo;Encyclop&aelig;dia&rsquo;
aspired to make.&nbsp; A history of Poetry was, of course, quite
impossible; it followed that the treatise must be an essay on the
principles of poetic art in relation to all other arts, as
exemplified by the poetry of the great literatures.&nbsp; It was
decided, according to Minto&rsquo;s account, that there were but
three men, that is to say, Swinburne, Matthew Arnold, and
Theodore Watts, who could produce this special kind of work, the
other critics being entirely given up to the historic method of
criticism.&nbsp; The choice fell upon Watts, and Baynes went to
London for the purpose of inviting him to do the work, and
explaining exactly what was wanted.</p>
<p>I think all will agree with me that there never was a happier
choice.&nbsp; Mr. Arthur Symons, in an article on &lsquo;The
Coming of Love&rsquo; in the &lsquo;Saturday Review&rsquo; has
written very luminously upon this subject.&nbsp; He tells us
that, wide as is the sweep of the treatise, it is but a brilliant
fragment, owing to the treatise having vastly overflowed the
space that could be given to it.&nbsp; The truth is that the
essay is but the introduction to an exhaustive discussion of what
the writer believes to be the most important event in the history
of all poetry&mdash;the event discussed under the name of
&lsquo;The Renascence of Wonder.&rsquo;&nbsp; The introduction to
the third volume of the new edition of Chambers&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Cyclop&aelig;dia of English Literature&rsquo; is but a
bare outline of Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s writings upon this
subject.&nbsp; It has been said over and over again that since
the best critical work of Coleridge there has been nothing in our
literature to equal this treatise on Poetry.&nbsp; It has been
exhaustively discussed in England, America, and on the Continent,
especially in Germany, where it has been compared to the critical
system of Goethe.&nbsp; Those who <a name="page258"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 258</span>have not read it will be surprised
to hear that it is not confined to the formulating of
generalizations on poetic art; it is full of eloquent passages on
human life and human conduct.</p>
<p>It was in an article upon a Restoration comic dramatist,
Vanbrugh, that Mr. Watts-Dunton first formulated his famous
distinction between comedy and farce:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In order to find and fix Vanbrugh&rsquo;s
place among English comic dramatists, an examination of the very
basis of the comedy of repartee inaugurated by Etheredge would be
necessary, and, of course, such an examination would be
impossible here.&nbsp; It is chiefly as a humourist, however,
that he demands attention.</p>
<p>Given the humorous temperament&mdash;the temperament which
impels a man to get his enjoyment by watching the harlequinade of
life, and contrasting it with his own ideal standard of good
sense, which the harlequinade seems to him to mock and
challenge&mdash;given this temperament, then the quality of its
humourous growth depends of course on the quality of the
intellectual forces by means of which the temperament gains
expression.&nbsp; Hence it is very likely that in original
endowment of humour, as distinguished from wit, Vanbrugh was
superior to Congreve.&nbsp; And this is saying a great deal: for,
while Congreve&rsquo;s wit has always been made much of, it has,
since Macaulay&rsquo;s time, been the fashion among critics to do
less than justice to his humour&mdash;a humour which, in such
scenes as that in &lsquo;Love for Love,&rsquo; where Sir Sampson
Legend discourses upon the human appetites and functions, moves
beyond the humour of convention and passes into natural
humour.&nbsp; It is, however, in spontaneity, in a kind of
lawless merriment, almost Aristophanic in its verve, that
Vanbrugh&rsquo;s <a name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
259</span>humour seems so deep and so fine, seems indeed to
spring from a fountain deeper and finer and rarer than
Congreve&rsquo;s.&nbsp; A comedy of wit, like every other drama,
is a story told by action and dialogue, but to tell a story
lucidly and rapidly by means of repartee is exceedingly
difficult, not but that it is easy enough to produce
repartee.&nbsp; But in comic dialogue the difficulty is to move
rapidly and yet keep up the brilliant ball-throwing demanded in
this form; and without lucidity and rapidity no drama, whether of
repartee or of character, can live.&nbsp; Etheredge, the father
of the comedy of repartee, has at length had justice done to him
by Mr. Gosse.&nbsp; Not only could Etheredge tell a story by
means of repartee alone: he could produce a tableau too; so could
Congreve, and so also could Vanbrugh; but often&mdash;far too
often&mdash;Vanbrugh&rsquo;s tableau is reached, not by fair
means, as in the tableau of Congreve, but by a surrendering of
probability, by a sacrifice of artistic fusion, by an inartistic
mingling of comedy and farce, such as Congreve never indulges
in.&nbsp; Jeremy Collier was perfectly right, therefore, in his
strictures upon the farcical improbabilities of the
&lsquo;Relapse.&rsquo;&nbsp; So farcical indeed are the tableaux
in that play that the broader portions of it were (as Mr.
Swinburne discovered) adapted by Voltaire and acted at Sceaux as
a farce.&nbsp; Had we space here to contrast the
&lsquo;Relapse&rsquo; with the &lsquo;Way of the World,&rsquo; we
should very likely come upon a distinction between comedy and
farce such as has never yet been drawn.&nbsp; We should find that
farce is not comedy with a broadened grin&mdash;Thalia with her
girdle loose and run wild&mdash;as the critics seem to
assume.&nbsp; We should find that the difference between the two
is not one of degree at all, but rather one of kind, and that
mere breadth of fun has nothing to do with the question.&nbsp; No
doubt the fun of <a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
260</span>comedy may be as broad as that of farce, as is shown
indeed by the celebrated Dogberry scenes in &lsquo;Much Ado about
Nothing&rsquo; and by the scene in &lsquo;Love for Love&rsquo;
between Sir Sampson Legend and his son, alluded to above; but
here, as in every other department of art, all depends upon the
quality of the imaginative belief that the artist seeks to arrest
and secure.&nbsp; Of comedy the breath of life is dramatic
illusion.&nbsp; Of farce the breath of life is mock
illusion.&nbsp; Comedy, whether broad or genteel, pretends that
its mimicry is real.&nbsp; Farce, whether broad or genteel, makes
no such pretence, but, by a thousand tricks, which it keeps up
between itself and the audience, says, &lsquo;My acting is all
sham, and you know it.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now, while Vanbrugh was apt
too often to forget this the fundamental difference between
comedy and farce, Congreve never forgot it, Wycherly
rarely.&nbsp; Not that there should be in any literary form any
arbitrary laws.&nbsp; There is no arbitrary law declaring that
comedy shall not be mingled with farce, and yet the fact is that
in vital drama they cannot be so mingled.&nbsp; The very laws of
their existence are in conflict with each other, so much so that
where one lives the other must die, as we see in the drama of our
own day.&nbsp; The fact seems to be that probability of incident,
logical sequence of cause and effect, are as necessary to comedy
as they are to tragedy, while farce would stifle in such an
air.&nbsp; Rather, it would be poisoned by it, just as comedy is
poisoned by what farce flourishes on; that is to say,
inconsequence of reasoning&mdash;topsy-turvy logic.&nbsp; Born in
the fairy country of topsy-turvy, the logic of farce would be
illogical if it were not upside-down.&nbsp; So with coincidence,
with improbable accumulation of convenient events&mdash;farce can
no more exist without these than comedy can exist with
them.&nbsp; Hence we affirm that <a name="page261"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 261</span>Jeremy Collier&rsquo;s strictures on
the farcical adulterations of the &lsquo;Relapse&rsquo; pierce
more deeply into Vanbrugh&rsquo;s art than do the criticisms of
Leigh Hunt and Hazlitt.&nbsp; In other words, perhaps the same
lack of fusion which mars Vanbrugh&rsquo;s architectural ideas
mars also his comedy.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without for a moment wishing to institute comparisons between
the merit of Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s literary articles and the
merit of other literary articles by other contemporary writers, I
may at least say that between his articles and theirs the
difference is not one of degree, it is one of kind.&nbsp; Theirs
are compact, business-like compressions of facts admirably fitted
for an Encyclop&aelig;dia.&nbsp; No attempt is made to formulate
generalizations upon the principles of literary art, and this
must be said in their praise&mdash;they are faultless as articles
in a book of reference.&nbsp; But no student of Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s work who turns over the pages of an article
in the &lsquo;Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica&rsquo; can fail after
reading a few sentences to recognize the author.&nbsp;
Generalizations, hints of daring theories, novel and startling
speculations, graze each other&rsquo;s heels, until one is
dazzled by the display of intellectual brilliance.&nbsp; That his
essays are out of place in an Encyclop&aelig;dia may be true, but
they seem to lighten and alleviate it and to shed his fascinating
idiosyncrasy upon their coldly impersonal environment.</p>

</a></p>
<p>I have been allowed to enrich this volume with photographs of
&lsquo;The Pines&rsquo; and of some of the exquisite works of art
therein.&nbsp; But it is unfortunate for me that I am not allowed
to touch upon what are the most important relations of Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s life&mdash;important though so many of them
are.&nbsp; I mean his intimacy with the poet whose name is now
beyond doubt far above any other name in the contemporary world
of letters.&nbsp; I do not sympathize with the
hyper-sensitiveness of eminent men with regard to privacy.&nbsp;
The inner chamber of what Rossetti calls the &lsquo;House of
Life&rsquo; should be kept sacred.&nbsp; But Rossetti&rsquo;s own
case shows how impossible it is in these days to keep those
recesses inviolable.&nbsp; The fierce light that beats upon men
of genius grows fiercer and fiercer every day, and it cannot be
quenched.&nbsp; This was one of my arguments when I first
answered Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s own objection to the appearance
of this monograph.&nbsp; The times have changed since he was a
young man.&nbsp; Then publicity was shunned like a plague by
poets and by painters.&nbsp; If such men wish the light to be
true as well as fierce, they must allow their friends to
illuminate their &lsquo;House of Life&rsquo; by the lamp of
truth.&nbsp; If Rossetti during his lifetime had allowed one of
his friends who knew the secrets of his &lsquo;House of
Life&rsquo; to write about him, we might have been spared those
<a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 263</span>canards
about him and the wife he loved which were rife shortly after his
death.&nbsp; Byron&rsquo;s reluctance to take payment for his
poetry was not a more belated relic of an old quixotism than is
this dying passion for privacy.&nbsp; Publicity may be an evil,
but it is an inevitable evil, and great men must not let the
wasps and the gadflies monopolize its uses.&nbsp; It may be a
reminiscence of an older and a nobler social temper, the temper
under the influence of which Rossetti in 1870 said that he felt
abashed because a paragraph had appeared in the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; announcing the fact that a book from
him was forthcoming.&nbsp; But that temper has gone by for
ever.&nbsp; We live now in very different times.&nbsp; Scores
upon scores of unauthorized and absolutely false paragraphs about
eminent men are published, especially about these two friends who
have lived their poetic life together for more than a quarter of
a century.&nbsp; Only the other day I saw in a newspaper an
offensive descriptive caricature of Mr. Swinburne, of his dress,
etc.&nbsp; It is interesting to recall the fact that mendacious
journalism was the cause of Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s very first
contribution to the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um,&rsquo; before he wrote
any reviews at all.&nbsp; At that time the offenders seem to have
been chiefly Americans.&nbsp; The article was not a review, but a
letter signed &lsquo;Z,&rsquo; entitled &lsquo;The Art of
Interviewing,&rsquo; and it appeared in the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um,&rsquo; of March 11, 1876.&nbsp; As it
shows the great Swinburne myth in the making, I will reproduce
this merry little skit:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Alas! there is none of us without
his skeleton-closet,&rsquo; said a great writer to one who was
congratulating him upon having reached the goal for which he had,
from the first, set out.&nbsp; &lsquo;My skeleton bears the
dreadful name of &ldquo;American Interviewer.&rdquo;&nbsp; Pity
me!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Is he <a name="page264"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 264</span>an American with a diary in his
pocket?&rsquo; was the terrified question always put by another
man of genius, whenever you proposed introducing a stranger to
him.&nbsp; But this was in those ingenuous Parker-Willisian days
when the &lsquo;Interviewer&rsquo; merely invented the
dialogue&mdash;not the entire dramatic action&mdash;not the
interview itself.&nbsp; Primitive times! since when the
&lsquo;Interviewer&rsquo; has developed indeed!&nbsp; His
dramatic inspiration now is trammelled by none of those foolish
and arbitrary conditions which&mdash;whether his scene of action
was at the &lsquo;Blue Posts&rsquo; with Thackeray, or in the
North with Scottish lords&mdash;vexed and bounded the noble soul
of the great patriarch of the tribe.&nbsp; Uncribbed, uncabined,
unconfined, the &lsquo;Interviewer&rsquo; now invents, not merely
the dialogue, but the &lsquo;situation,&rsquo; the place, the
time&mdash;the interview itself.&nbsp; Every dramatist has his
favourite character&mdash;Sophocles had his; Shakspeare had his;
Schiller had his; the &lsquo;Interviewer&rsquo; has his.&nbsp;
Mr. Swinburne has, for the last two or three years,
been&mdash;for some reason which it might not be difficult to
explain&mdash;the &lsquo;Interviewer&rsquo;s&rsquo; special
favourite.&nbsp; Moreover, the accounts of the interviews with
him are always livelier than any others, inasmuch as they are
accompanied by brilliant fancy-sketches of his personal
appearance&mdash;sketches which, if they should not gratify him
exactly, would at least astonish him; and it is surely something
to be even astonished in these days.&nbsp; Some time ago, for
instance, an American lady journalist, connected with a
&lsquo;Western newspaper,&rsquo; made her appearance in London,
and expressed many &lsquo;great desires,&rsquo; the greatest of
all her &lsquo;desires&rsquo; being to know the author of
&lsquo;Atalanta,&rsquo; or, if she could not know him, at least
to &lsquo;see him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Fates, however, were not kind to the lady.&nbsp; The
author of &lsquo;Atalanta&rsquo; had quitted London.&nbsp; She
did <a name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>not
see him, therefore&mdash;not with her bodily eyes could she see
him.&nbsp; Yet this did not at all prevent her from
&lsquo;interviewing&rsquo; him.&nbsp; Why should it?&nbsp; The
&lsquo;soul hath eyes and ears&rsquo; as well as the
body&mdash;especially if the soul is an American soul, with a
mission to &lsquo;interview.&rsquo;&nbsp; There soon appeared in
the lady&rsquo;s Western newspaper a graphic account of one of
the most interesting interviews with this poet that has ever yet
been recorded.&nbsp; Mr. Swinburne&mdash;though at the time in
Scotland&mdash;&lsquo;called&rsquo; upon the lady at her rooms in
London; but, notwithstanding this unexampled feat of courtesy, he
seems to have found no favour in the lady&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; She
&lsquo;misliked him for his complexion.&rsquo;&nbsp; Evidently it
was nothing but good-breeding that prevented her from telling the
bard, on the spot, that he was physically an unlovely bard.&nbsp;
His manners, too, were but so-so; and the Western lady was
shocked and disgusted, as well she might be.&nbsp; In the midst
of his conversation, for example, he called out frantically for
&lsquo;pen and ink.&rsquo;&nbsp; He had become suddenly and
painfully &lsquo;afflated.&rsquo;&nbsp; When furnished with pen
and ink he began furiously writing a poem, beating the table with
his left hand and stamping the floor with both feet as he did
so.&nbsp; Then, without saying a word, he put on his hat and
rushed from the room like a madman!&nbsp; This account was copied
into other newspapers and into the magazines.&nbsp; It is, in
fact, a piece of genuine history now, and will form valuable
material for some future biographer of the poet.&nbsp; The
stubborn shapelessness of facts has always distressed the
artistically-minded historian.&nbsp; But let the American
&lsquo;Interviewer&rsquo; go on developing thus, and we may look
for History&rsquo;s becoming far more artistic and symmetrical in
future.&nbsp; The above is but one out of many instances of the
art of interviewing.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>It is
all very well to say that irresponsible statements of this kind
are not in the true sense of the word believed by readers; they
create an atmosphere of false mist which destroys altogether the
picture of the poet&rsquo;s life which one would like to
preserve.&nbsp; And I really think that it would have been better
if I or some one else among the friends of the poets had been
allowed to write more freely about the beautiful and intellectual
life at &lsquo;The Pines.&rsquo;&nbsp; But I am forbidden to do
this, as the following passage in a letter which I have received
from Mr. Watts-Dunton will show:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I cannot have anything about our life at
&lsquo;The Pines&rsquo; put into print, but I will grant you
permission to give a few reproductions of the interesting works
of art here, for many of them may have a legitimate interest for
the public on account of their historic value, as having come to
me from the magician of art, Rossetti.&nbsp; And I assure you
that this is a concession which I have denied to very many
applicants, both among friends and others.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s allusion to the Rossetti mementoes
requires a word of explanation.&nbsp; Rossetti, it seems, was
very fond of surprising his friends by unexpected tokens of
generosity.&nbsp; I have heard Mr. Watts-Dunton say that during
the week when he was moving into &lsquo;The Pines,&rsquo; he
spent as usual Wednesday night at 16 Cheyne Walk, and he and
Rossetti sat talking into the small hours.&nbsp; Next morning
after breakfast he strolled across to Whistler&rsquo;s house to
have a talk with the ever-interesting painter, and this resulted
in his getting home two hours later than usual.&nbsp; On reaching
the new house he saw a waggon standing in <a
name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>front of
it.&nbsp; He did not understand this, for the furniture from the
previous residence had been all removed.&nbsp; He went up to the
waggon, and was surprised to find it full of furniture of a
choice kind.&nbsp; But there was no need for him to give much
time to an examination of the furniture, for he found he was
familiar with every piece of it.&nbsp; It had come straight from
Rossetti&rsquo;s house, having been secretly packed and sent off
by Dunn on the previous day.&nbsp; Some of the choicest things at
&lsquo;The Pines&rsquo; came in this way.&nbsp; Not a word had
Rossetti said about this generous little trick on the night
before.&nbsp; The superb Chinese cabinet, a photograph of which
appears in this book, belonged to Rossetti.&nbsp; It seems that
on a certain occasion Frederick Sandys, or some one else, told
Rossetti that the clever but ne&rsquo;er-do-well artist, George
Chapman, had bought of a sea-captain, trading in Chinese waters,
a wonderful piece of lacquer work of the finest
period&mdash;before the Manchu pig-tail time.&nbsp; The captain
had bought it of a Frenchman who had aided in looting the
Imperial Palace.&nbsp; Rossetti, of course, could not rest until
he had seen it, and when he had seen it, he could not rest until
he had bought it of Chapman; and it was taken across to 16 Cheyne
Walk, where it was greatly admired.&nbsp; The captain had
barbarously mutilated it at the top in order to make it fit in
his cabin, and it remained in that condition for some
years.&nbsp; Afterwards Rossetti gave it to Mr. Watts-Dunton, who
got it restored and made up by the wonderful amateur carver, the
late Mr. T. Keynes, who did the carving on the painted cabinet
also photographed for this book.&nbsp; There is a long and
interesting story in connection with this piece of Chinese
lacquer, but I have no room to tell it here.</p>

<p>All I am allowed to say about the relations between <a
name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 268</span>Mr.
Watts-Dunton and Mr. Swinburne is that the friendship began in
1872, that it soon developed into the closest intimacy, not only
with the poet himself, but with all his family.&nbsp; In 1879 the
two friends became house-mates at &lsquo;The Pines,&rsquo; Putney
Hill, and since then they have never been separated, for Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s visits to the Continent, notably those with
the late Dr. Hake recorded in &lsquo;The New Day,&rsquo; took
place just before this time.&nbsp; The two poets thenceforth
lived together, worked together; saw their common friends
together, and travelled together.&nbsp; In 1882, after the death
of Rossetti they went to the Channel Islands, staying at St.
Peter&rsquo;s Port, Guernsey, for some little time, and then at
Petit Bot Bay.&nbsp; Their swims in this beautiful bay Mr.
Watts-Dunton commemorated in two of the opening sonnets of
&lsquo;The Coming of Love&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">NATURE&rsquo;S FOUNTAIN
OF YOUTH</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">(A MORNING
SWIM OFF GUERNSEY WITH A FRIEND)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if the Spring&rsquo;s fresh groves should
change and shake<br />
To dark green woods of Orient terebinth,<br />
Then break to bloom of England&rsquo;s hyacinth,<br />
So &rsquo;neath us change the waves, rising to take<br />
Each kiss of colour from each cloud and flake<br />
Round many a rocky hall and labyrinth,<br />
Where sea-wrought column, arch, and granite plinth,<br />
Show how the sea&rsquo;s fine rage dares make and break.<br />
Young with the youth the sea&rsquo;s embrace can lend,<br />
Our glowing limbs, with sun and brine empearled,<br />
Seem born anew, and in your eyes, dear friend,<br />
Rare pictures shine, like fairy flags unfurled,<br />
Of child-land, where the roofs of rainbows bend<br />
Over the magic wonders of the world</p>

<p>These are the &lsquo;Coloured Caves&rsquo; the sea-maid
built;<br />
Her walls are stained beyond that lonely fern,<br />
For she must fly at every tide&rsquo;s return,<br />
And all her sea-tints round the walls are spilt.<br />
Outside behold the bay, each headland gilt<br />
With morning&rsquo;s gold; far off the foam-wreaths burn<br />
Like fiery snakes, while here the sweet waves yearn<br />
Up sand more soft than Avon&rsquo;s sacred silt.<br />
And smell the sea! no breath of wood or field,<br />
From lips of may or rose or eglantine,<br />
Comes with the language of a breath benign,<br />
Shuts the dark room where glimmers Fate revealed,<br />
Calms the vext spirit, balms a sorrow unhealed,<br />
Like scent of sea-weed rich of morn and brine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The two friends afterwards went to Sark.&nbsp; A curious
incident occurred during their stay in the island.&nbsp; The two
poet-swimmers received a bravado challenge from
&lsquo;Orion&rsquo; Horne, who was also a famous swimmer, to swim
with him round the whole island of Sark!&nbsp; I need hardly say
that the absurd challenge was not accepted.</p>
<p>During the cruise Mr. Swinburne conceived and afterwards wrote
some glorious poetry.&nbsp; In the same year the two friends went
to Paris, as I have already mentioned, to assist at the Jubilee
of &lsquo;Le Roi s&rsquo;Amuse.&rsquo;&nbsp; Since then their
love of the English coasts and the waters which wash them, seems
to have kept them in England.&nbsp; For two consecutive years
they went to Sidestrand, on the Norfolk coast, for bathing.&nbsp;
It was there that Mr. Swinburne wrote some of his East Anglian
poems, and it was there that Mr. Watts-Dunton conceived the East
coast parts of &lsquo;Aylwin.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was during one of
these visits that Mr. Swinburne first made the acquaintance of
Grant Allen, who had long been an intimate friend of <a
name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The two, indeed, were drawn together
by the fact that they both enjoyed science as much as they
enjoyed literature.&nbsp; It was a very interesting meeting, as
Grant Allen had long been one of Swinburne&rsquo;s most ardent
admirers, and his social charm, his intellectual sweep and
brilliance, made a great impression on the poet.&nbsp; Since then
their visits to the sea have been confined to parts of the
English Channel, such as Eastbourne, where they were near
neighbours of Rossetti&rsquo;s friends, Lord and Lady Mount
Temple, between whom and Mr. Watts-Dunton there had been an
affectionate intimacy for many years&mdash;but more notably
Lancing, whither they went for three consecutive years.&nbsp; For
several years they stayed during their holiday with Lady Mary
Gordon, an aunt of Mr. Swinburne&rsquo;s, at &lsquo;The
Orchard,&rsquo; Niton Bay, Isle of Wight.&nbsp; During the hot
summer of 1904 they were lucky enough to escape to Cromer, where
the temperature was something like twenty degrees lower than that
of London.&nbsp; A curious incident occurred during this visit to
Cromer.&nbsp; One day Mr. Watts-Dunton took a walk with another
friend to &lsquo;Poppy-land,&rsquo; where he and Mr. Swinburne
had previously stayed, in order to see there again the landslips
which he has so vividly described in &lsquo;Aylwin.&rsquo;&nbsp;
While they were walking from &lsquo;Poppyland&rsquo; to the old
ruined churchyard called &lsquo;The Garden of Sleep,&rsquo; they
sat down for some time in the shade of an empty hut near the
cliff.&nbsp; Coming back Mr. Watts-Dunton said that the cliff
there was very dangerous, and ought to be fenced off, as the
fatal land-springs were beginning to show their work.&nbsp; Two
or three weeks after this a portion of the cliff at that point,
weighing many thousands of tons, fell into the sea, and the hut
with it.</p>

</a></p>
<p>A friendship so affectionate and so long as the friendship <a
name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 271</span>between
these two poets is perhaps without a parallel in
literature.&nbsp; It has been frequently and beautifully
commemorated.&nbsp; When Mr. Swinburne&rsquo;s noble poem,
&lsquo;By the North Sea,&rsquo; was published, it was prefaced by
this sonnet:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">TO WALTER THEODORE
WATTS</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">&lsquo;WE ARE WHAT SUNS AND WINDS AND
WATERS MAKE US.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right">Landor.</p>
<p>Sea, wind, and sun, with light and sound and breath<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The spirit of man fulfilling&mdash;these create<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; That joy wherewith man&rsquo;s life grown
passionate<br />
Gains heart to hear and sense to read and faith<br />
To know the secret word our Mother saith<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In silence, and to see, though doubt wax great,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Death as the shadow cast by life on fate,<br />
Passing, whose shade we call the shadow of death.</p>
<p>Brother, to whom our Mother, as to me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is dearer than all dreams of days undone,<br />
This song I give you of the sovereign three<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That are, as life and sleep and death are, one:<br
/>
A song the sea-wind gave me from the sea,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where nought of man&rsquo;s endures before the
sun.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>1882 was a memorable year in the life of Mr.
Watts-Dunton.&nbsp; The two most important volumes of poetry
published in that year were dedicated to him.&nbsp;
Rossetti&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ballads and Sonnets,&rsquo; the book
which contains the chief work of his life, bore the following
inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">TO</span><br />
<span class="GutSmall">THEODORE WATTS</span><br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE FRIEND WHOM MY VERSE WON FOR
ME,</span><br />
<span class="GutSmall">THESE FEW MORE PAGES</span><br />
<span class="GutSmall">ARE AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 272</span>A few
weeks later Mr. Swinburne&rsquo;s &lsquo;Tristram of
Lyonesse,&rsquo; the volume which contains what I regard as his
ripest and richest poetry, was thus inscribed:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">TO MY BEST FRIEND</span><br />
<span class="GutSmall">THEODORE WATTS</span><br />
<span class="GutSmall">I DEDICATE IN THIS BOOK</span><br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE BEST I HAVE TO GIVE HIM.</span></p>
<p>Spring speaks again, and all our woods are stirred,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And all our wide glad wastes aflower around,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That twice have made keen April&rsquo;s clarion
sound<br />
Since here we first together saw and heard<br />
Spring&rsquo;s light reverberate and reiterate word<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shine forth and speak in season.&nbsp; Life stands
crowned<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Here with the best one thing it ever found,<br />
As of my soul&rsquo;s best birthdays dawns the third.</p>
<p>There is a friend that as the wise man saith<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cleaves closer than a brother: nor to me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath time not shown, through days
like waves at strife<br />
This truth more sure than all things else but death,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This pearl most perfect found in all the sea<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That washes toward your feet these
waifs of life.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Pines</span>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>April</i>,
1882.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the finest of all these words of affection are perhaps
those opening the dedicatory epistle prefixed to the magnificent
Collected Edition of Mr. Swinburne&rsquo;s poems issued by
Messrs. Chatto and Windus in 1904:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;To my best and dearest friend I dedicate
the first collected edition of my poems, and to him I address
what I have to say on the occasion.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once also Mr. Watts-Dunton dedicated verses of his own to Mr.
Swinburne, to wit, in 1897, when he published <a
name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 273</span>that
impassioned lyric in praise of a nobler and larger Imperialism,
the &lsquo;Jubilee Greeting at Spithead to the Men of Greater
Britain&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;TO OUR GREAT
CONTEMPORARY WRITER OF<br />
PATRIOTIC POETRY,<br />
ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE.</p>
<p>You and I are old enough to remember the time when, in the
world of letters at least, patriotism was not so fashionable as
it is now&mdash;when, indeed, love of England suggested
Philistinism rather than &lsquo;sweetness and light.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Other people, such as Frenchmen, Italians, Irishmen, Hungarians,
Poles, might give voice to a passionate love of the land of their
birth, but not Englishmen.&nbsp; It was very curious, as I
thought then, and as I think now.&nbsp; And at that period love
of the Colonies was, if possible, even more out of fashion than
was love of England; and this temper was not confined to the
&lsquo;cultured&rsquo; class.&nbsp; It pervaded society and had
an immense influence upon politics.&nbsp; On one side the
Manchester school, religiously hoping that if the Colonies could
be insulted so effectually that they must needs (unless they
abandoned all self-respect) &lsquo;set up for themselves,&rsquo;
the same enormous spurt would be given to British trade which
occurred after the birth of the United States, bade the Colonies
&lsquo;cut the painter.&rsquo;&nbsp; On the other hand the old
Tories and Whigs, with a few noble exceptions, having never
really abandoned the old traditions respecting the unimportance
of all matters outside the parochial circle of European
diplomacy, scarcely knew where the Colonies were situated on the
map.</p>
<p>There was, however, in these islands one person who saw as
clearly then as all see now the infinite importance of the
expansion of England to the true progress of <a
name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
274</span>mankind&mdash;the Great Lady whose praises in this
regard I have presumed to sing in the opening stanza of these
verses.</p>
<p>I may be wrong, but I, who am, as you know, no courtier,
believe from the bottom of my heart that without the influence of
the Queen this expansion would have been seriously delayed.&nbsp;
Directly and indirectly her influence must needs be enormous,
and, as regards this matter, it has always been
exercised&mdash;energetically and even eagerly exercised&mdash;in
one way.&nbsp; This being my view, I have for years been urging
more than one friend clothed with an authority such as I do not
possess to bring the subject prominently before the people of
England at a time when England&rsquo;s expansion is a phrase in
everybody&rsquo;s mouth.&nbsp; I have not succeeded.&nbsp; Let
this be my apology for undertaking the task myself and for
inscribing to you, as well as to the men of Greater Britain,
these lines.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I feel that it is a great privilege to be able to present to
my readers beautiful photogravures and photographs of interiors
and pictures and works of art at &lsquo;The Pines.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Many of the pictures and other works of art at &lsquo;The
Pines&rsquo; are mementoes of a most interesting kind.</p>
<p>Among these is the superb portrait of Madox Brown, at this
moment hanging in the Bradford Exhibition.&nbsp; Madox Brown
painted it for the owner.&nbsp; An interesting story is connected
with it.&nbsp; One day, not long after Mr. Watts-Dunton had
become intimate with Madox Brown, the artist told him he
specially wanted his boy Nolly to read to him a story that he had
been writing, and asked him to meet the boy at dinner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nolly been writing a story!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr.
Watts-Dunton.</p>
<p><a name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
275</span>&lsquo;I understand your smile,&rsquo; said Madox
Brown; &lsquo;but you will find it better than you
think.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At this time Oliver Madox Brown seemed a loose-limbed
hobbledehoy, young enough to be at school.&nbsp; After dinner
Oliver began to read the opening chapters of the story in a not
very impressive way, and Mr. Watts-Dunton suggested that he
should take it home and read it at his leisure.&nbsp; This was
agreed to.&nbsp; Pressure of affairs prevented him from taking it
up for some time.&nbsp; At last he did take it up, but he had
scarcely read a dozen pages when he was called away, and he asked
a member of his family to gather up the pages from the sofa and
put them into an escritoire.&nbsp; On his return home at a very
late hour he found the lady intently reading the manuscript, and
she declared that she could not go to bed till she had finished
it.</p>
<p>On the next day Mr. Watts-Dunton again took up the manuscript,
and was held spellbound by it.&nbsp; It was a story of passion,
of intense love, and intense hate, told with a crude power that
was irresistible.</p>
<p>Mr. Watts-Dunton knew Smith Williams (the reader of Smith,
Elder &amp; Co.), whose name is associated with &lsquo;Jane
Eyre.&rsquo;&nbsp; He showed it to Williams, who was greatly
struck by it, but pointed out that it terminated in a violent
scene which the novel-reading public of that time would not like,
and asked for a concluding scene less daring.&nbsp; The ending
was modified, and the story, when it appeared, attracted very
great attention.&nbsp; Madox Brown was so grateful to Mr.
Watts-Dunton for his services in the matter that he insisted on
expressing his gratitude in some tangible form.&nbsp; Miss Lucy
Madox Brown (afterwards Mrs. W. M. Rossetti) was consulted, and
at once suggested a portrait of the painter, painted by
himself.&nbsp; This was done, and the result was the masterpiece
which <a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
276</span>has been so often exhibited.&nbsp; From that moment
Oliver Madox Brown took his place in the literary world of his
time.&nbsp; The mention of Oliver Madox Brown will remind the
older generation of his friendship with Philip Bourke Marston,
the blind poet, one of the most pathetic chapters in literary
annals.</p>

<p>Although Rossetti never fulfilled his intention of
illustrating what he called &lsquo;Watts&rsquo;s magnificent star
sonnet,&rsquo; he began what would have been a superb picture
illustrating Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s sonnet, &lsquo;The Spirit
of the Rainbow.&rsquo;&nbsp; He finished a large charcoal drawing
of it, which is thus described by Mr. William Sharp in his book,
&lsquo;Dante Gabriel Rossetti: a Record and a
Study&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It represents a female figure standing in a
gauzy circle composed of a rainbow, and on the frame is written
the following sonnet (the poem in question by Mr.
Watts-Dunton):</p>
<p style="text-align: center">THE WOOD-HAUNTER&rsquo;S DREAM</p>
<p>The wild things loved me, but a wood-sprite said:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Though meads are sweet when
flowers at morn uncurl,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And woods are sweet with
nightingale and merle,<br />
Where are the dreams that flush&rsquo;d thy childish bed?<br />
The Spirit of the Rainbow thou would&rsquo;st wed!&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I rose, I found her&mdash;found a rain-drenched
girl<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose eyes of azure and limbs like roseate pearl<br
/>
Coloured the rain above her golden head.</p>
<p>But when I stood by that sweet vision&rsquo;s side<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw no more the Rainbow&rsquo;s lovely stains;<br
/>
To her by whom the glowing heavens were dyed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sun showed naught but dripping woods and
plains:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;God gives the world the Rainbow, her
the rains,&rsquo;<br />
The wood-sprite laugh&rsquo;d, &lsquo;Our seeker finds a
bride!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
277</span>Rossetti meant to have completed the design with the
&lsquo;woods and plains&rsquo; seen in perspective through the
arch; and the composition has an additional and special interest
because it is the artist&rsquo;s only successful attempt at the
wholly nude&mdash;the &lsquo;Spirit&rsquo; being extremely
graceful in poise and outline.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I am able to give a reproduction of another of
Rossetti&rsquo;s beautiful studies which has never been
published, but which has been very much talked about.&nbsp; Many
who have seen it at &lsquo;The Pines&rsquo; agree with the late
Lord de Tabley that Rossetti in this crayon created the loveliest
of all his female faces.&nbsp; It is thus described by Mr.
William Sharp: &ldquo;The drawing, which, for the sake of a name,
I will call &lsquo;Forced Music,&rsquo; represents a nude
half-figure of a girl playing on a medi&aelig;val stringed
instrument elaborately ornamented.&nbsp; The face is of a type
unlike that of any other of the artist&rsquo;s subjects, and
extraordinarily beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I should explain that the background and the ragged garb of
the girl in the version of the picture here reproduced, are by
Dunn.&nbsp; These two exquisite drawings were made from the same
girl, who never sat for any other pictures.&nbsp; Her face has
been described as being unlike that of any other of
Rossetti&rsquo;s models and yet combining the charm of them
all.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I am strictly prohibited by the subject of this study from
giving any personal description of him.&nbsp; For my part I do
not sympathize with this extreme sensitiveness and dislike to
having one&rsquo;s personal characteristics described <a
name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>in
print.&nbsp; What is there so dreadful or so sacred in mere
print?&nbsp; The feeling upon this subject is a reminiscence, I
think, of archaic times, when between conversation and printed
matter there was &lsquo;a great gulf fixed.&rsquo;&nbsp; Both Mr.
Watts-Dunton and his friend Mr. Swinburne must be aware that as
soon as they have left any gathering of friends or strangers,
remarks&mdash;delicate enough, no doubt&mdash;are made about
them, as they are made about every other person who is talked
about in ever so small a degree.&nbsp; Not so very long ago I
remained in a room after Mr. Watts-Dunton had left it.&nbsp;
Straightway there were the freest remarks about him, not in the
least unkind, but free.&nbsp; Some did not expect to see so dark
a man; some expected to see him much darker than they found him
to be; some recalled the fact that Miss Corkran, in her
reminiscences, described his dark-brown eyes as
&lsquo;green&rsquo;&mdash;through a printer&rsquo;s error, no
doubt.&nbsp; Some then began to contrast his appearance with that
of his absent friend, Mr. Swinburne&mdash;and so on, and so
on.&nbsp; Now, what is the difference between being thus
discussed in print and in conversation?&nbsp; Merely that the
printed report reaches a wider&mdash;a little
wider&mdash;audience.&nbsp; That is all.&nbsp; I do not think it
is an unfair evasion of his prohibition to reproduce one of the
verbal snap-shots of him that have appeared in the papers.&nbsp;
Some energetic gentleman&mdash;possibly some one living in the
neighbourhood&mdash;took the following &lsquo;Kodak&rsquo; of
him.&nbsp; It appeared in &lsquo;M.A.P.&rsquo; and it is really
as good a thumb-nail portrait of him as could be painted.&nbsp;
In years to come, when he and I and the &lsquo;Kodaker&rsquo; are
dead, it may be found more interesting, perhaps, than anything I
have written about him:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Every, or nearly every, morning, as the
first glimmer <a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
279</span>of dawn lightens the sky, there appears on Wimbledon
Common a man, whose skin has been tanned by sun and wind to the
rich brown of the gypsies he loves so well; his forehead is
round, and fairly high; his brown eyes and the brow above them
give his expression a piercing appearance.&nbsp; For the rest,
his voice is firm and resonant, and his brown hair and thick
moustache are partially shot with grey.&nbsp; But he looks not a
day over forty-five.&nbsp; Generally he carries a book.&nbsp;
Often, however, he turns from it to watch the birds and the
rabbits.&nbsp; For&mdash;it will be news to lie-abeds of the
district&mdash;Wimbledon Common is lively with rabbits, revelling
in the freshness of the dawn, rabbits which ere the rush for the
morning train begins, will all have vanished until the moon rises
again.&nbsp; To him, morning, although he has seen more sunrises
than most men, still makes an ever fresh and glorious
pageant.&nbsp; This usually solitary figure is that of Mr.
Theodore Watts-Dunton, and to his habit of early rising the
famous poet, novelist, and critic ascribes his remarkable health
and vigour.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The holidays of the two poets have not been confined to their
visits to the sea-side.&nbsp; One place of retreat used to be the
residence of the late Benjamin Jowett, at Balliol, when the men
were down, or one of his country places, such as Boar&rsquo;s
Hill.</p>
<p>I have frequently heard Mr. Swinburne and Mr. Watts-Dunton
talk about the famous Master of Balliol.&nbsp; I have heard Mr.
Swinburne recall the great admiration which Jowett used to
express for Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s intellectual powers and
various accomplishments.&nbsp; There was no one, I have heard Mr.
Swinburne say, whom Jowett held in greater esteem.&nbsp; That air
of the college don, which has been described by certain of
Jowett&rsquo;s friends, <a name="page280"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 280</span>left the Master entirely when he was
talking to Mr. Watts-Dunton.</p>
<p>Among the pleasant incidents in Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s life
were these visits with Mr. Swinburne to Jowett&rsquo;s house,
where he had the opportunity of meeting some of the most
prominent men of the time.&nbsp; He has described the Balliol
dinner parties, but I have no room here to do more than allude to
them.&nbsp; I must, however, quote his famous pen portrait of
Jowett which appeared in the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; of
December 22, 1894.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It may seem difficult to imagine many
points of sympathy between the poet of &lsquo;Atalanta&rsquo; and
the student of Plato and translator of Thucydides; and yet the
two were bound to each other by ties of no common strength.&nbsp;
They took expeditions into the country together, and Mr.
Swinburne was a not infrequent guest at Balliol and also at
Jowett&rsquo;s quiet autumnal retreat at Boar&rsquo;s Hill.&nbsp;
The Master of Balliol, indeed, had a quite remarkable faculty of
drawing to himself the admiration of men of poetic genius.&nbsp;
To say which poet admired and loved him most
deeply&mdash;Tennyson, Browning, Matthew Arnold, or Mr.
Swinburne&mdash;would be difficult.&nbsp; He seemed to join their
hands all round him, and these intimacies with the poets were not
the result of the smallest sacrifice of independence on the part
of Jowett.&nbsp; He was always quite as frank in telling a poet
what he disliked in his verses as in telling him what he
liked.&nbsp; And although the poets of our own epoch are,
perhaps, as irritable a race as they were in times past, and are
as little impervious as ever to flattery, it is, after all, in
virtue partly of a superior intelligence that poets are poets,
and in the long run their friendship is permanently given to <a
name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
281</span>straightforward men like Jowett.&nbsp; That
Jowett&rsquo;s judgment in artistic matters, and especially in
poetry, was born&eacute; no one knew better than himself, and he
had a way of letting the poets see that upon poetical subjects he
must be taken as only a partially qualified judge, and this alone
gained for him a greater freedom in criticism than would
otherwise have been allowed to him.&nbsp; For, notwithstanding
the Oxford epigram upon him as a pretender to absolute wisdom, no
man could be more modest than he upon subjects of which he had
only the ordinary knowledge.&nbsp; He was fond of quoting
Hallam&rsquo;s words that without an exhaustive knowledge of
details there can be no accurate induction; and where he saw that
his interlocutor really had special knowledge, he was singularly
diffident about expressing his opinion.&nbsp; They are not so far
wrong who take it for granted that one who was able to secure the
loving admiration of four of the greatest poets of the Victorian
epoch, all extremely unlike each other, was not only a great and
a rare intelligence, but a man of a nature most truly noble and
most truly lovable.&nbsp; The kind of restraint in social
intercourse resulting from what has been called his taciturnity
passed so soon as his interlocutor realized (which he very
quickly did) that Jowett&rsquo;s taciturnity, or rather his lack
of volubility, arose from the peculiarly honest nature of one who
had no idea of talking for talking&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; If a
proper and right response to a friend&rsquo;s remark chanced to
come to his lips spontaneously, he was quite willing to deliver
it; but if the response was neither spontaneous nor likely to be
adequate, he refused to manufacture one for the mere sake of
keeping the ball rolling, as is so often the case with the
shallow or uneducated man.&nbsp; It is, however, extremely
difficult to write reminiscences of men so taciturn as
Jowett.&nbsp; In <a name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
282</span>order to bring out one of Jowett&rsquo;s pithy sayings,
the interlocutor who would record it has also to record the words
of his own which awoke the saying, and then it is almost
impossible to avoid an appearance of egotism.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still more pleasurable than these relaxations at Oxford were
the visits that the two friends used to pay to Jowett&rsquo;s
rural retreat at Boar&rsquo;s Hill, about three miles from
Oxford, for the purpose of revelling in the riches of the
dramatic room in the Bodleian.&nbsp; The two poets used to spend
the entire day in that enchanted room, and then walk back with
the Master to Boar&rsquo;s Hill.&nbsp; Every reader of Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s poetry will remember the following
sonnets:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">THE LAST WALK FROM BOAR&rsquo;S
HILL<br />
To A. C. S.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">I</p>
<blockquote><p>One after one they go; and glade and heath,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where once we walked with them, and garden bowers<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; They made so dear, are haunted by the hours<br />
Once musical of those who sleep beneath;<br />
One after one does Sorrow&rsquo;s every wreath<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bind closer you and me with funeral flowers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Love and Memory from each loss of ours<br />
Forge conquering glaives to quell the conqueror Death.</p>
<p>Since Love and Memory now refuse to yield<br />
The friend with whom we walk through mead and field<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To-day as on that day when last we parted,<br />
Can he be dead, indeed, whatever seem?<br />
Love shapes a presence out of Memory&rsquo;s dream,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A living presence, Jowett golden-hearted.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">II</p>
<p>Can he be dead?&nbsp; We walk through flowery ways<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From Boar&rsquo;s Hill down to Oxford, fain to
know<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
283</span>What nugget-gold, in drift of Time&rsquo;s long
flow,<br />
The Bodleian mine hath stored from richer days;<br />
He, fresh as on that morn, with sparkling gaze,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hair bright as sunshine, white as moonlit snow,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Still talks of Plato while the scene below<br />
Breaks gleaming through the veil of sunlit haze.</p>
<p>Can he be dead?&nbsp; He shares our homeward walk,<br />
And by the river you arrest the talk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To see the sun transfigure ere he sets<br />
The boatmen&rsquo;s children shining in the wherry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And on the floating bridge the ply-rope wets,<br />
Making the clumsy craft an angel&rsquo;s ferry.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">III</p>
<p>The river crossed, we walk &rsquo;neath glowing skies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through grass where cattle feed or stand and
stare<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With burnished coats, glassing the coloured
air&mdash;<br />
Fading as colour after colour dies:<br />
We pass the copse; we round the leafy rise&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Start many a coney and partridge, hern and hare;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; We win the scholar&rsquo;s nest&mdash;his simple
fare<br />
Made royal-rich by welcome in his eyes.</p>
<p>Can he be dead?&nbsp; His heart was drawn to you.<br />
Ah! well that kindred heart within him knew<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The poet&rsquo;s heart of gold that gives the
spell!<br />
Can he be dead?&nbsp; Your heart being drawn to him,<br />
How shall ev&rsquo;n Death make that dear presence dim<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For you who loved him&mdash;us who loved him
well?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another and much lovelier retreat, whither Mr. Watts-Dunton
has always loved to go, is the cottage at Box-hill.&nbsp; Not the
least interesting among the beautiful friendships between Mr.
Watts-Dunton and his illustrious contemporaries is that between
himself and Mr. George Meredith.&nbsp; Mr. William Sharp can
speak with authority on this subject, being himself the intimate
friend of Mr. Meredith, Mr. Swinburne, and Mr.
Watts-Dunton.&nbsp; <a name="page284"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 284</span>Speaking of Swinburne&rsquo;s
championship, in the &lsquo;Spectator,&rsquo; of Meredith&rsquo;s
first book of poems, Mr. Sharp, in an article in the &lsquo;Pall
Mall Magazine,&rsquo; of December 1901, says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Among those who read and considered&rdquo;
[Meredith&rsquo;s work] &ldquo;was another young poet, who had,
indeed, already heard of Swinburne as one of the most promising
of the younger men, but had not yet met him. . . .&nbsp; If the
letter signed &lsquo;A. C. Swinburne&rsquo; had not appeared,
another signed &lsquo;Theodore Watts&rsquo; would have been
published, to the like effect.&nbsp; It was not long before the
logic of events was to bring George Meredith, A. C. Swinburne,
and Theodore Watts into personal communion.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first important recognition of George Meredith as a poet
was the article by Mr. Watts-Dunton in the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; on &lsquo;Poems and Lyrics of the
Joy of Earth.&rsquo;&nbsp; After this appeared articles
appreciative of Meredith&rsquo;s prose fiction by W. E. Henley
and others.&nbsp; But it was Mr. Watts-Dunton who led the
way.&nbsp; The most touching of all the testimonies of love and
admiration which Mr. Meredith has received from Mr Watts-Dunton,
or indeed, from anybody else, is the beautiful sonnet addressed
to him on his seventy-fourth birthday.&nbsp; It appeared in the
&lsquo;Saturday Review&rsquo; of February 15, 1902:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">TO GEORGE MEREDITH<br
/>
<span class="GutSmall">(ON HIS SEVENTY-FOURTH
BIRTHDAY)</span></p>
<p>This time, dear friend&mdash;this time my birthday greeting<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Comes heavy of funeral tears&mdash;I think of
you,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And say, &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis evening with
him&mdash;that is true&mdash;<br />
But evening bright as noon, if faster fleeting;<br />
Still he is spared&mdash;while Spring and Winter, meeting,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Clasp hands around the roots &rsquo;neath frozen
dew&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To see the &lsquo;Joy of Earth&rsquo; break forth
anew,<br />
And hear it on the hillside warbling, bleating.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
285</span>Love&rsquo;s remnant melts and melts; but, if our
days<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are swifter than a weaver&rsquo;s shuttle, still,<br
/>
Still Winter has a sun&mdash;a sun whose rays<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Can set the young lamb dancing on the hill,<br />
And set the daisy, in the woodland ways,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dreaming of her who brings the daffodil.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The allusion to &lsquo;funeral tears&rsquo; was caused by one
of the greatest bereavements which Mr. Watts-Dunton has sustained
in recent years, namely, that of Frank Groome, whose obituary he
wrote for the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um.&rsquo;&nbsp; I have not the
honour of knowing Meredith, but I have often heard Mr.
Watts-Dunton describe with a glow of affectionate admiration the
fine charm of his character and the amazing pregnancy in thought
and style of his conversation.</p>
<p>But the most memorable friendship that during their joint
occupancy of &lsquo;The Pines&rsquo; Mr Watts-Dunton formed, was
that with Tennyson.</p>
<p>I have had many conversations with Mr. Watts-Dunton on the
subject of Tennyson, and I am persuaded that, owing to certain
incongruities between the external facets of Tennyson&rsquo;s
character and the &lsquo;abysmal deeps&rsquo; of his personality,
Mr. Watts-Dunton, after the poet&rsquo;s son, is the only man
living who is fully competent to speak with authority of the
great poet.&nbsp; Not only is he himself a poet who must be
placed among his contemporaries nearest to his more illustrious
friend, but between Mr. Watts-Dunton and Tennyson from their
first meeting there was an especial sympathy.&nbsp; So long ago
as 1881 was published his sonnet to Tennyson on his seventy-first
birthday.&nbsp; It attracted much attention, and although it was
not sent to the Laureate, he read it and was much touched by it,
as well he might be, for it is as noble a tribute as one poet
could pay to another:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
286</span><span class="smcap">To Alfred Tennyson, on his
publishing, in his seventy-first year, the most richly various
volume of English verse that has appeared in his own
century</span>.</p>
<p>Beyond the peaks of Kaf a rivulet springs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose magic waters to a flood expand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Distilling, for all drinkers on each hand,<br />
The immortal sweets enveiled in mortal things.<br />
From honeyed flowers,&mdash;from balm of zephyr-wings,&mdash;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; From fiery blood of gems, <a
name="citation286"></a><a href="#footnote286"
class="citation">[286]</a> through all the land,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The river draws;&mdash;then, in one rainbow-band,<br
/>
Ten leagues of nectar o&rsquo;er the ocean flings.</p>
<p>Rich with the riches of a poet&rsquo;s years,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Stained in all colours of Man&rsquo;s destiny,<br />
So, Tennyson, thy widening river nears<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The misty main, and, taking now the sea,<br />
Makes rich and warm with human smiles and tears<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The ashen billows of Eternity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some two or three years after this Mr. Watts-Dunton met the
Laureate at a garden party, and they fraternized at once.&nbsp;
Mr. Watts-Dunton had an open invitation to Aldworth and
Farringford whenever he could go, and this invitation came after
his very first stay at Aldworth.&nbsp; One point in which he does
not agree with Coleridge (in the &lsquo;Table Talk&rsquo;) or
with Mr. Swinburne, is the theory that Tennyson&rsquo;s ear was
defective at the very first.&nbsp; He contends that if Tennyson
in his earlier poems seemed to show a defective ear, it was
always when in the great struggle between the demands of mere
metrical music and those of the other great requisites of poetry,
thought, emotion, colour and outline, he found it best
occasionally to make metrical music in some measure yield.&nbsp;
As an illustration of Tennyson&rsquo;s sensibility to the most <a
name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 287</span>delicate
nuances of metrical music, I remember at one of those charming
&lsquo;symposia&rsquo; at &lsquo;The Pines,&rsquo; hearing Mr.
Watts-Dunton say that Tennyson was the only English poet who gave
the attention to the sibilant demanded by Dionysius of
Halicarnassus; and I remember one delightful instance that he
gave of this.&nbsp; It referred to the two sonnets upon
&lsquo;The Omnipotence of Love&rsquo; in the universe which I
have always considered to be the keynote of &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo;
and &lsquo;The Coming of Love.&rsquo;&nbsp; These sonnets
appeared in an article called &lsquo;The New Hero&rsquo; in the
&lsquo;English Illustrated Magazine&rsquo; in 1883.&nbsp; Mr.
Watts-Dunton was staying at Aldworth when the proof of the
article reached him.&nbsp; The present Lord Tennyson (who, as Mr.
Watts-Dunton has often averred, has so much literary insight that
if he had not been the son of the greatest poet of his time, he
would himself have taken a high position in literature) read out
in one of the little Aldworth bowers to his father and to Miss
Mary Boyle the article and the sonnets.&nbsp; Tennyson, who was a
severe critic of his own work, but extremely lenient in
criticising the work of other men, said there was one feature in
one of the lines of one of the sonnets which he must
challenge.&nbsp; The line was this:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>And scents of flowers and shadow of wavering
trees.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now it so chanced that this very line had been especially
praised by two other fine critics, D. G. Rossetti and William
Morris, to whom the sonnet had been read in manuscript.&nbsp;
Tennyson&rsquo;s criticism was that there were too many sibilants
in the line, and that although, other things being equal,
&lsquo;scents&rsquo; might be more accurate than
&lsquo;scent,&rsquo; this was a case where the claims of music
ought to be dominant over other claims.&nbsp; The present Lord
Tennyson took the same view, and I am sure they <a
name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 288</span>were right,
and that Mr. Watts-Dunton was right, in finally adopting
&lsquo;scent&rsquo; in place of &lsquo;scents.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Watts-Dunton has always contended that Tennyson&rsquo;s
sensibility to criticism was the result, not of imperious
egotism, but of a kind of morbid modesty.&nbsp; Tennyson used to
say that &ldquo;to whatsoever exalted position a poet might
reach, he was not &lsquo;born to the purple,&rsquo; and that if
the poet&rsquo;s mind was especially plastic he could never shake
off the reminiscence of the time when he was nobody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On a certain occasion Tennyson took Mr. Watts-Dunton into the
summer-house at Aldworth to read to him &lsquo;Becket,&rsquo;
then in manuscript.&nbsp; Although another visitor, whom he
esteemed very highly, both as a poet and an old friend, was
staying there, Tennyson said that he should prefer to read the
play to Mr. Watts-Dunton alone.&nbsp; And this no doubt was
because he desired an absolute freedom of criticism.&nbsp;
Freedom of criticism we may be sure he got, for of all men Mr.
Watts-Dunton is the most outspoken on the subject of the
poet&rsquo;s art.&nbsp; The entire morning was absorbed in the
reading; and, says Mr. Watts-Dunton, &lsquo;the remarks upon
poetic and dramatic art that fell from Tennyson would have made
the fortune of any critic.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On the subject of what has been called Tennyson&rsquo;s
gaucherie and rudeness to women I have seen Mr. Watts-Dunton wax
very indignant.&nbsp; &lsquo;There was to me,&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;the greatest charm in what is called Tennyson&rsquo;s
bluntness.&nbsp; I would there were a leaven of Tennyson&rsquo;s
single-mindedness in the society of the present day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One anecdote concerning what is stigmatized as
Tennyson&rsquo;s rudeness to women shows how entirely the man was
misunderstood.&nbsp; Mrs. Oliphant has stated that Tennyson, <a
name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 289</span>in his own
house, after listening in silence to an interchange of amiable
compliments between herself and Mrs. Tennyson, said abruptly,
&lsquo;What liars you women are!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I seem to
hear,&rsquo; said Mr. Watts-Dunton, &lsquo;Tennyson utter the
exclamation&mdash;utter it in that tone of humourous playfulness,
followed by that loud guffaw, which neutralized the rudeness as
entirely as Douglas Jerrold&rsquo;s laugh neutralized the sting
of his satire.&nbsp; For such an incident to be cited as instance
of Tennyson&rsquo;s rudeness to women is ludicrous.&nbsp; When I
knew him I was, if possible, a more obscure literary man than I
now am, and he treated me with exactly the same manly respect
that he treated the most illustrious people.&nbsp; I did not feel
that I had any claim to such treatment, for he was, beyond doubt,
the greatest literary figure in the world of that time.&nbsp;
There seems unfortunately to be an impulse of detraction, which
springs up after a period of laudation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The only thing I have heard Mr. Watts-Dunton say in the way of
stricture upon Tennyson&rsquo;s work was that, considering his
enormous powers as a poet, he seemed deficient in the gift of
inventing a story:&mdash;&ldquo;The stanzas beginning, &lsquo;O,
that &rsquo;twere possible&rsquo;&mdash;the nucleus of
&lsquo;Maud&rsquo;&mdash;appeared originally in &lsquo;The
Tribute.&rsquo;&nbsp; They were the finest lines that Tennyson
ever wrote&mdash;right away the finest.&nbsp; They suggested some
superb story of passion and mystery; and every reader was
compelled to make his own guess as to what the story could
possibly be.&nbsp; In an evil moment some friend suggested that
Tennyson should amplify this glorious lyric into a story.&nbsp; A
person with more of the endowment of the inventor than Tennyson
might perhaps have invented an adequate story&mdash;might perhaps
have invented a dozen adequate stories; but he could not have
invented a worse story <a name="page290"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 290</span>than the one used by Tennyson in the
writing of his monodrama.&nbsp; But think of the poetic riches
poured into it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I remember a peculiarly subtle criticism that Mr. Watts-Dunton
once made in regard to &lsquo;The Princess.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Shakspeare,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is the only poet who
has been able to put sincere writing into a story the plot of
which is fanciful.&nbsp; The extremely insincere story of
&lsquo;The Princess&rsquo; is filled with such noble passages of
sincere poetry as &lsquo;Tears, idle tears,&rsquo; &lsquo;Home
they brought her warrior dead,&rsquo; etc., passages which
unfortunately lose two-thirds of their power through the
insincere setting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not very long before Tennyson died, the editor of the
&lsquo;Magazine of Art&rsquo; invited Mr. Watts-Dunton to write
an article upon the portraits of Tennyson.&nbsp; Mr. Watts-Dunton
consulted the poet upon this project, and he agreed, promising to
aid in the selection of the portraits.&nbsp; The result was two
of the most interesting essays upon Tennyson that have ever been
written&mdash;in fact, it is no exaggeration to say that without
a knowledge of these articles no student of Tennyson can be
properly equipped.&nbsp; It is tantalizing that they have never
been reprinted.&nbsp; Tennyson died before their appearance, and
this, of course, added to the general interest felt in them.</p>
<p>After Tennyson&rsquo;s death Mr. Watts-Dunton wrote two
penetrating essays upon Tennyson in the &lsquo;Nineteenth
Century,&rsquo; one of them being his reminiscences of Tennyson
as the poet and the man, and the other a study of him as a
nature-poet in reference to evolution.&nbsp; It will be a great
pity if these essays too are not reprinted.&nbsp; Mr. Knowles,
the editor, also included Mr. Watts-Dunton among the friends of
Tennyson who were invited to write memorial verses on his death
for the <a name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
291</span>&lsquo;Nineteenth Century.&rsquo;&nbsp; To this series
Mr. Watts-Dunton contributed the following sonnet, which is one
of the several poems upon Tennyson not published in &lsquo;The
Coming of Love&rsquo; volume, which, I may note in passing,
contains &lsquo;What the Silent Voices Said,&rsquo; the fine
&lsquo;sonnet sequence&rsquo; commemorating the burial of
Tennyson:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">IN WESTMINSTER
ABBEY</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">The
crowd in the abbey was very great</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Morning Newspaper.</p>
<p>I saw no crowd: yet did these eyes behold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What others saw not&mdash;his lov&rsquo;d face
sublime<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneath that pall of death in deathless prime<br />
Of Tennyson&rsquo;s long day that grows not old;<br />
And, as I gazed, my grief seemed over-bold;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And, &lsquo;Who art thou,&rsquo; the music seemed to
chime,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;To mourn that King of song whose throne
is Time?&rsquo;<br />
Who loves a god should be of godlike mould.</p>
<p>Then spake my heart, rebuking Sorrow&rsquo;s shame:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;So great he was, striving in simple strife<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; With Art alone to lend all beauty life&mdash;<br />
So true to Truth he was, whatever came&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So fierce against the false when lies were
rife&mdash;<br />
That love o&rsquo;erleapt the golden fence of Fame.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the invitation of the present Lord Tennyson, Mr.
Watts-Dunton was one of the few friends of the poet, including
Jowett, F. W. H. Myers, F. T. Palgrave, the late Duke of Argyll,
and others, who contributed reminiscences of him to the
&lsquo;Life.&rsquo;&nbsp; In a few sentences he paints this
masterly little miniature of Tennyson, entitled,
&lsquo;Impressions: 1883&ndash;1892&rsquo; <a
name="citation291"></a><a href="#footnote291"
class="citation">[291]</a>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;All are agreed that D. G. Rossetti&rsquo;s
was a peculiarly winning personality, but no one has been in the
least able <a name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
292</span>to say why.&nbsp; Nothing is easier, however, than to
find the charm of Tennyson.&nbsp; It lay in a great veracity of
soul: it lay in a simple single-mindedness, so childlike that,
unless you had known him to be the undoubted author of poems as
marvellous for exquisite art as for inspiration, you could not
have supposed but that all subtleties&mdash;even those of poetic
art&mdash;must be foreign to a nature so simple.</p>
<p>Working in a language like ours&mdash;a language which has to
be moulded into harmony by a myriad subtleties of art&mdash;how
can this great, inspired, simple nature be the delicate-fingered
artist of &lsquo;The Princess,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Palace of
Art,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Day-Dream,&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Dream of
Fair Women&rsquo;?</p>
<p>Tennyson knew of but one justification for the thing he
said&mdash;viz. that it was the thing he thought.&nbsp; Behind
his uncompromising directness was apparent a noble and a splendid
courtesy of the grand old type.&nbsp; As he stood at the porch of
Aldworth meeting a guest or bidding him good-bye&mdash;as he
stood there, tall far beyond the height of average men, his skin
showing dark and tanned by the sun and wind&mdash;as he stood
there, no one could mistake him for anything but a great
forthright English gentleman.&nbsp; Always a man of an
extraordinary beauty of presence, he showed up to the last the
beauty of old age to a degree rarely seen.&nbsp; He was the most
hospitable of men.&nbsp; It was very rare indeed for him to part
from a guest without urging him to return, and generally with the
words, &lsquo;Come whenever you like.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Tennyson&rsquo;s knowledge of nature&mdash;nature in every
aspect&mdash;was simply astonishing.&nbsp; His passion for
&lsquo;stargazing&rsquo; has often been commented upon by readers
of his poetry.&nbsp; Since Dante, no poet in any land has so
loved the stars.&nbsp; He had an equal delight in watching the <a
name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 293</span>lightning;
and I remember being at Aldworth once during a thunderstorm, when
I was alarmed at the temerity with which he persisted, in spite
of all remonstrances, in gazing at the blinding lightning.&nbsp;
For moonlight effects he had a passion equally strong, and it is
especially pathetic to those who know this to remember that he
passed away in the light he so much loved&mdash;in a room where
there was no artificial light&mdash;nothing to quicken the
darkness but the light of the full moon, which somehow seems to
shine more brightly at Aldworth than anywhere else in
England.</p>
<p>In a country having a composite language such as ours it may
be affirmed with special emphasis that there are two kinds of
poetry: one appealing to the uncultivated masses, the other
appealing to the few who are sensitive to the felicitous
expression of deep thought and to the true beauties of poetic
art.</p>
<p>Of all poets Shakespeare is the most popular, and yet in his
use of what Dante calls the &lsquo;sieve for noble words&rsquo;
his skill transcends that of even Milton, Coleridge, Shelley, and
Keats.&nbsp; His felicities of thought and of diction in the
great passages seem little short of miraculous, and there are so
many that it is easy to understand why he is so often spoken of
as being a kind of inspired improvisatore.&nbsp; That he was not
an improvisatore, however, any one can see who will take the
trouble to compare the first edition of &lsquo;Romeo and
Juliet&rsquo; with the received text, the first sketch of
&lsquo;The Merry Wives of Windsor&rsquo; with the play as we now
have it, and the &lsquo;Hamlet&rsquo; of 1603 with the
&lsquo;Hamlet&rsquo; of 1604, and with the still further varied
version of the play given by Heminge and Condell in the Folio of
1623.&nbsp; Next to Shakespeare in this great power of combining
the forces of the two great classes of English poets, appealing
both <a name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 294</span>to
the commonplace public and to the artistic sense of the few,
stands, perhaps, Chaucer; but since Shakespeare&rsquo;s time no
one has met with anything like Tennyson&rsquo;s success in
effecting a reconciliation between popular and artistic sympathy
with poetry in England.&rdquo;</p>

AMERICAN FRIENDS: LOWELL, BRET HARTE, AND OTHERS</h2>
<p>I feel that my hasty notes about Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s
literary friendships would be incomplete without a word or two
upon his American friends.&nbsp; There is a great deal of
interest in the story of the first meeting between him and James
Russell Lowell.&nbsp; Shortly after Lowell had accepted the post
of American Minister in England, Mr. Watts-Dunton met him at
dinner.&nbsp; During the dinner Mr. Watts-Dunton was somewhat
attracted by the conversation of a gentleman who sat next to him
but one.&nbsp; He observed that the gentleman seemed to talk as
if he wished to entice him into the conversation.&nbsp; The
gentleman was passing severe strictures upon English
writers&mdash;Dickens, Thackeray, and others.&nbsp; As the dinner
wore on, his conversation left literary names and took up
political ones, and he was equally severe upon the prominent
political figures of the time, and also upon the prominent
political men of the previous generation&mdash;Palmerston, Lord
John Russell, and the like.&nbsp; Then the name of the Alabama
came up; the gentleman (whom Mr. Watts-Dunton now discovered to
be an American), dwelt with much emphasis upon the iniquity of
England in letting the Alabama escape.&nbsp; This diatribe he
concluded thus: &lsquo;You know we owe England
nothing.&rsquo;&nbsp; In saying this he again looked at Mr.
Watts-Dunton, manifestly addressing his remarks to him.</p>
<p><a name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 296</span>These
attacks upon England and Englishmen and everything English had at
last irritated Mr. Watts-Dunton, and addressing the gentleman for
the first time, he said: &ldquo;Pardon me, sir, but there you are
wrong.&nbsp; You owe England a very great deal, for I see you are
an American.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do we owe England?&rdquo; said the gentleman, whom
Mr. Watts-Dunton now began to realize was no other than the newly
appointed American Minister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You owe England,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for an infinity
of good feeling which you are trying to show is quite
unreciprocated by Americans.&nbsp; So kind is the feeling of
English people towards Americans that socially, so far as the
middle classes are concerned, they have an immense advantage over
English people themselves.&nbsp; They are petted and made much
of, until at last it has come to this, that the very fact of a
person&rsquo;s being American is a letter of
introduction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Watts-Dunton spoke with such emphasis, and his voice is so
penetrating, that those on the opposite side of the table began
to pause in their conversation to listen to it, and this stopped
the little duel between the two.&nbsp; After the ladies had
retired, Mr. Lowell drew up his chair to Mr. Watts-Dunton and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were very sharp upon me just now, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; said Mr. Watts-Dunton.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You were making an onslaught on my poor little island, and
you really seemed as though you were addressing your conversation
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Mr. Lowell, &ldquo;I will confess
that I did address my conversation partially to you; you are, I
think, Mr. Theodore Watts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is my little name,&rdquo; said Mr.
Watts-Dunton.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I really don&rsquo;t see why that
should induce you to <a name="page297"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 297</span>address your conversation to
me.&nbsp; I suppose it is because absurd paragraphs have often
appeared in the American newspapers stating that I am strongly
anti-American in my sympathies.&nbsp; An entire mistake!&nbsp; I
have several charming American friends, and I am a great admirer
of many of your most eminent writers.&nbsp; But I notice that
whensoever an American book is severely handled in the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um,&rsquo; the article is attributed to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think,&rdquo; said Mr. Lowell, &ldquo;that you
are a lover of my country, but I am not one of those who
attribute to you articles that you never wrote.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he then drew his chair nearer to his interlocutor, and
became more confidential.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will tell you something
that, I think, will not be altogether unpleasant to you.&nbsp;
When I came to take up my permanent residence in London a short
time ago, I was talking to a friend of mine about London and
Londoners, and I said to him: &lsquo;There is one man whom I very
much want to meet.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;You!&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;why, you can meet anybody from the royal family
downwards.&nbsp; Who is the man you want to meet?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;It is a man in the literary world,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;and I have no doubt you can introduce me to him.&nbsp; It
is the writer of the chief poetical criticism in the
&ldquo;Athen&aelig;um.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; My friend
laughed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, it is curious,&rsquo; he replied:
&lsquo;that is one of the few men in the literary world I cannot
introduce you to.&nbsp; I scarcely know him, and, besides, not
long ago he passed strictures on my writing which I don&rsquo;t
much approve of.&rsquo;&nbsp; Does that interest you?&rdquo;
added Mr. Lowell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very much,&rdquo; said Mr. Watts-Dunton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it interest you to know that ever since your
first article in the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; I have read
every article you have written?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
298</span>&ldquo;Very much,&rdquo; said Mr. Watts-Dunton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it interest you to know that on reading your
first article I said to a friend of mine: &lsquo;At last there is
a new voice in English criticism?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very much,&rdquo; said Mr. Watts-Dunton.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But you must first tell me what that article was, for I
don&rsquo;t believe there is one of my countrymen who could do
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That article,&rdquo; said Lowell, &ldquo;was an essay
upon the &lsquo;Comedy of the Noctes Ambrosian&aelig;,&rsquo; and
it opened with an Oriental anecdote.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Watts-Dunton, &ldquo;that does
interest me very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I will go further,&rdquo; said Lowell: &ldquo;every
line you have written in the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; has
been read by me, and often re-read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Watts-Dunton, &ldquo;I confess to
being amazed, for I assure you that in my own country, except
within a narrow circle of friends, my name is absolutely
unknown.&nbsp; And I must add that I feel honoured, for it is not
a week since I told a friend that I have a great admiration for
some of your critical essays.&nbsp; But still, I don&rsquo;t
quite forgive you for your onslaught upon my poor little
island!&nbsp; My sympathies are not strongly John Bullish, and
they tell me that my verses are more Celtic than Anglo-Saxon in
temper.&nbsp; But I am somewhat of a patriot, in my way, and I
don&rsquo;t quite forgive you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The meeting ended in the two men fraternizing with each
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come to see me,&rdquo; said Lowell,
&ldquo;at the Embassy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you ought to know!&rdquo; said Lowell.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Another proof of the stout sufficiency of the English
temper&mdash;<a name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
299</span>not to know where the American Embassy is!&nbsp; It is
in Lowndes Square.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he named the number.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Mr. Watts-Dunton, &ldquo;that is next
door to Miss Swinburne, aunt of the poet, a perfectly marvellous
lady, possessing the vitality of the Swinburne family&mdash;a
lady who makes watercolour landscape drawings in the open air at
I don&rsquo;t know what age of life&mdash;something like
eighty.&nbsp; She was a friend of Turner&rsquo;s, and is the
possessor of some of Turner&rsquo;s finest works.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you actually go next door, and don&rsquo;t know
where the American Embassy is!&nbsp; A crowning proof of the
insolent self-sufficiency of the English temper!&nbsp; However,
as you come next door, won&rsquo;t you come and see
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be delighted,&rdquo; said Mr. Watts-Dunton;
&ldquo;but I am perfectly sure you can spare no time to see an
obscure literary man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; said Lowell, &ldquo;I always
reserve to myself an hour, from five to six, when I see nobody
but a friend over a cigarette.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some time after this Mr. Watts-Dunton did call on Lowell, and
spent an hour with him over a cigarette; and at last it became an
institution, this hour over a cigarette once a week.</p>
<p>This went on for a long time, and Mr. Watts-Dunton is fond of
recalling the way in which Lowell&rsquo;s Anglophobia became
milder and milder, &lsquo;fine by degrees and beautifully
less,&rsquo; until at last it entirely vanished.&nbsp; Then it
was followed by something like Anglo-mania.&nbsp; Lowell began to
talk with the greatest appreciation of a thousand English
institutions and ways which he would formerly have
deprecated.&nbsp; The climax of this revolution was reached when
Mr. Watts-Dunton said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lowell, you are now so much more of a John Bull <a
name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 300</span>than I am
that I have ceased to be able to follow you.&nbsp; The English
ladies are&mdash;let us say, charming; English gentlemen
are&mdash;let us say, charming, or at least some of them.&nbsp;
Everything is charming!&nbsp; But there is one thing you cannot
say a word for, and that is our detestable climate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you can really speak thus of the finest climate in
the world!&rdquo; said Lowell.&nbsp; &ldquo;I positively cannot
live out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Watts-Dunton, &ldquo;you and I
will cease to talk about England and John Bull, if you
please.&nbsp; I cannot follow you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In relating this anecdote Mr. Watts-Dunton, however, insisted
that with all his love of England, Lowell never bated one jot of
his loyalty to his own country.&nbsp; There never was a stauncher
American than James Russell Lowell.&nbsp; Let one unjust word be
said about America, and he was a changed man.&nbsp; Mr.
Watts-Dunton has always contended that the present good feeling
between the two great branches of the Anglo-Saxon race was due
mainly to Lowell.&nbsp; Indeed, he expressed this conviction in
one of his finest sonnets.&nbsp; It appeared in the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; after Lowell&rsquo;s death, and it
has been frequently reprinted in the United States.&nbsp; It now
appears in &lsquo;The Coming of Love.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was
addressed &lsquo;To Britain and America: On the Death of James
Russell Lowell,&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>Ye twain who long forgot your brotherhood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And those far fountains whence, through glorious
years,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Your fathers drew, for Freedom&rsquo;s pioneers,<br
/>
Your English speech, your dower of English blood&mdash;<br />
Ye ask to-day, in sorrow&rsquo;s holiest mood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When all save love seems film&mdash;ye ask in
tears&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;How shall we honour him whose name
endears<br />
The footprints where beloved Lowell stood?&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 301</span>Your
hands he joined&mdash;those fratricidal hands,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Once trembling, each, to seize a brother&rsquo;s
throat:<br />
How shall ye honour him whose spirit stands<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Between you still?&mdash;Keep Love&rsquo;s bright
sails afloat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For Lowell&rsquo;s sake, where once ye strove and
smote<br />
On waves that must unite, not part, your strands.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This perhaps is the place to say a word about Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s feelings towards America, which were once
supposed to be hostile.&nbsp; Apart from his intimacy with
Lowell, he numbered among his American friends Clarence Stedman,
Mrs. Moulton (between whom and himself there has been the most
cordial intimacy during twenty-five years), Bret Harte, Edwin
Abbey, Joaquin Miller, Colonel Higginson, and, indeed, many
prominent Americans.&nbsp; Between Whistler and himself there was
an intimacy so close that during several years they saw each
other nearly every day.&nbsp; That was before Whistler&rsquo;s
genius had received full recognition.&nbsp; I may recall that
during a certain controversy concerning Whistler&rsquo;s
animosity against the Royal Academy the following letter from Mr.
Watts-Dunton appeared in the &lsquo;Times&rsquo; of August 12,
1903:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the &lsquo;Times&rsquo; of to-day Mr. G.
D. Leslie, R.A., says: &lsquo;I was on friendly terms with
Whistler for nearly forty years, and I never heard him at any
time testify animosity against the Academy or its
members.&rsquo;</p>
<p>My own acquaintance with Whistler did not extend over forty
years, but for about ten years I was very intimate with him, so
intimate that during part of this period we met almost every
day.&nbsp; Indeed, at one time we were jointly engaged on a
weekly periodical called &lsquo;Piccadilly,&rsquo; for which Du
Maurier designed the cover, and for which Whistler furnished his
very first lithographs, <a name="page302"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 302</span>by the valuable aid of Mr. T.
Way.&nbsp; During that time there were not many days when he
failed to &lsquo;testify animosity&rsquo; against the Academy and
its members.&nbsp; To say the truth, the testifications on this
subject by &lsquo;Jimmy,&rsquo; as he was then called, were a
little afflictive to his friends.&nbsp; Whether he was right or
wrong in the matter is a point on which I feel unqualified to
express an opinion.</p>
<p>May I be allowed to conclude this note by expressing my
admiration of your New York Correspondent&rsquo;s amazingly vivid
portrait of one of the most vivid personalities of our
time?&nbsp; It is a masterpiece. . . . &rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Bret Harte died, in May 1902, one of the best and most
appreciative estimates of him was written by Mr. Watts-Dunton for
the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um.&rsquo;&nbsp; I am tempted to quote it
nearly in full, as it shows deep sympathy with American
literature, and it will prove more conclusively than any words of
mine how warm are Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s feelings towards
Americans:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As a personality Bret Harte seems to have
exercised a great charm over his intimate friends, and I am not
in the least surprised at his being a favourite.&nbsp; It is many
years since I last saw him.&nbsp; I think it must have been at a
club dinner given by William Black; but I have a very vivid
remembrance of my first meeting him, which must have been more
than twenty-six years ago, and on that occasion it occurred to me
that he had great latent histrionic gifts, and, like Charles
Dickens, might have been an admirable actor.&nbsp; On that
account the following incident is worth recording.&nbsp; A friend
of mine, an American poet, who at that time was living in London,
brought him to my chambers, and did me the honour of introducing
me to him.&nbsp; Bret Harte had read something <a
name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 303</span>about the
London music-halls, and proposed that we should all three take a
drive round the town and see something of them.&nbsp; At that
time these places took a very different position in public
estimation from what they appear to be doing now.&nbsp; People
then considered them to be very cockney, very vulgar, and very
inane, as, indeed, they were, and were shy about going to
them.&nbsp; I hope they have improved now, for they seem to have
become quite fashionable.&nbsp; Our first visit was to the
Holborn Music Hall, and there we heard one or two songs that gave
the audience immense delight&mdash;some comic, some more comic
from being sentimental-maudlin.&nbsp; And we saw one or two
shapeless women in tights.&nbsp; Then we went to the
&lsquo;Oxford,&rsquo; and saw something on exactly the same
lines.&nbsp; In fact, the performers seemed to be the same as
those we had just been seeing.&nbsp; Then we went to other places
of the same kind, and Bret Harte agreed with me as to the
distressing emptiness of what my fellow-countrymen and women
seemed to be finding so amusing.&nbsp; At that time, indeed, the
almost only interesting entertainment outside the opera and the
theatres was that at Evans&rsquo;s supper-rooms, where, under the
auspices of the famous Paddy Green, one could enjoy a Welsh
rarebit while listening to the &lsquo;Chough and Crow&rsquo; and
&lsquo;The Men of Harlech,&rsquo; given admirably by
choir-boys.&nbsp; Years passed before I saw Bret Harte
again.&nbsp; I met him at a little breakfast party, and he amused
those who sat near him by giving an account of what he had seen
at the music-halls&mdash;an account so graphic that I think a
fine actor was lost in him.&nbsp; He not only vivified every
incident, but gave verbal descriptions of every performer in a
peculiarly quiet way that added immensely to the humour of
it.&nbsp; His style of acting would have been that of Jefferson
of &lsquo;Rip Van Winkle&rsquo; <a name="page304"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 304</span>fame.&nbsp; This proved to me what a
genius he had for accurate observation, and also what a
remarkable memory for the details of a scene.&nbsp; His death has
touched English people very deeply.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It is easy to be unjust to Bret Harte&mdash;easy to say that
he was a disciple of Dickens&mdash;easy to say that in richness,
massiveness, and variety he fell far short of his great and
beloved master.&nbsp; No one was so ready to say all this and
more about Bret Harte as Bret Harte himself.&nbsp; For of all the
writers of his time he was perhaps the most modest, the most
unobtrusive, the most anxious to give honour where he believed
honour to be due.</p>
<p>But the comparison between the English and American
story-tellers must not be pushed too far to the disadvantage of
the latter.&nbsp; If Dickens showed great superiority to Bret
Harte on one side of the imaginative writer&rsquo;s equipment,
there were, I must think, other sides of that equipment on which
the superiority was Bret Harte&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Therefore I am not one of those who think that in a court of
universal criticism Bret Harte&rsquo;s reputation will be found
to be of the usual ephemeral kind.&nbsp; It is, of course,
impossible to speak on such matters with anything like
confidence.&nbsp; But it does seem to me that Bret Harte&rsquo;s
reputation is more likely than is generally supposed to ripen
into what we call fame.&nbsp; For in his short stories&mdash;in
the best of them, at least&mdash;there is a certain note quite
indescribable by any adjective&mdash;a note which is, I believe,
always to be felt in the literature that survives.&nbsp; The
charge of not being original is far too frequently brought
against the imaginative writers of America.&nbsp; What do we mean
by &lsquo;originality&rsquo;?&nbsp; Scott did not invent the
historic method.&nbsp; Dickens simply carried the method of
Smollett further, and with wider range.&nbsp; <a
name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 305</span>Thackeray
is admittedly the nineteenth century Fielding.&nbsp; Perhaps,
indeed, there is but one absolutely original writer of prose
fiction of the nineteenth century&mdash;Nathaniel
Hawthorne.&nbsp; By original I mean simply original.&nbsp; I do
not mean that he was the greatest imaginative writer of his
epoch.&nbsp; But he invented a new kind of fiction altogether, a
fiction in which the material world and the spiritual world were
not merely brought into touch, but were positively intermingled
one with the other.</p>
<p>Bret Harte had the great good fortune to light upon material
for literary treatment of a peculiarly fresh and a peculiarly
fascinating kind, and he had the artistic instinct to treat it
adequately.&nbsp; This is what I mean: in the wonderful history
of the nineteenth century there are no more picturesque figures
than those goldseekers&mdash;those &lsquo;Argonauts&rsquo; of the
Pacific slope&mdash;who in 1848 and 1849 showed the world what
grit lies latent in the racial amalgam we agree to call
&lsquo;the Anglo-Saxon race.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Australian
gold-diggers of 1851 who followed them, although they were
picturesque and sturdy too, were not exactly of the strain of the
original Argonauts.&nbsp; The romance of the thing had been in
some degree worn away.&nbsp; The land of the Golden Fleece had
degenerated into a Tom Tiddler&rsquo;s Ground.&nbsp; Moreover,
the Tom Tiddler&rsquo;s Grounds of Ballarat and Bendigo were at a
comparatively easy distance from the Antipodean centre of
civilization.&nbsp; &lsquo;Canvas Town&rsquo; could easily be
reached from Sydney.&nbsp; But to reach the Golden Fleece sought
by the original Californian Argonauts the adventurer had before
him a journey of an almost unparalleled kind.&nbsp; Every
Argonaut, indeed, was a kind of explorer as well as seeker of
gold.&nbsp; He must either trek overland&mdash;that is to say,
over those vast prairies and then over those vast mountain <a
name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 306</span>chains
which to men of the time of Fenimore Cooper and Dr. Bird made up
the limitless &lsquo;far West&rsquo; regions which only a few
pioneers had dared to cross&mdash;or else he must take a journey,
equally perilous, round Cape Horn in the first crazy vessel in
which he could get a passage.&nbsp; It follows that for an
adventurer to succeed in reaching the land of the Golden Fleece
at all implied in itself that grit which adventurers of the
Anglo-Saxon type are generally supposed to show in a special
degree.&nbsp; What kind of men these Argonauts were, and what
kind of life they led, the people of the Eastern states of
America and the people of England had for years been trying to
gather from newspaper reports and other sources; but had it not
been for the genius of Bret Harte this most picturesque chapter
of nineteenth-century history would have been obliterated and
forgotten.&nbsp; Thanks to the admirable American writer whom
England had the honour and privilege of entertaining for so many
years, those wonderful regions and those wonderful doings in the
Sierra Nevada are as familiar to us as is Dickens&rsquo;s
London.&nbsp; Surely those who talk of Bret Harte as being
&lsquo;Dickens among the Californian pines&rsquo; do not consider
what their words imply.&nbsp; It is true, no doubt, that there
was a kind of kinship between the temperament of Dickens and the
temperament of Bret Harte.&nbsp; They both held the same
principles of imaginative art, they both felt that the function
of the artist is to aid in the emancipation of man by holding
before him beautiful ideals; both felt that to give him any kind
of so-called realism which lowers man in his
aspirations&mdash;which calls before man&rsquo;s imagination
degrading pictures of his &lsquo;animal origin&rsquo;&mdash;is to
do him a disservice.&nbsp; For man has still a long journey
before he reaches the goal.&nbsp; Yet though they were both by
instinct idealists as regards character-drawing, they both <a
name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 307</span>sought to
give their ideals a local habitation and a name by surrounding
those ideals with vividly painted real accessories, as real as
those of the ugliest realist.</p>
<p>With regard to Bret Harte&rsquo;s Argonauts and the romantic
scenery in which they lived and worked, it would, no doubt, be a
bold thing to say whether Dickens could or could not have painted
them, and whether, if he had painted them, the pictures would or
would not have been as good as Bret Harte&rsquo;s pictures.&nbsp;
But Dickens never did paint these Argonauts; he never had the
chance of painting them.&nbsp; Bret Harte did paint them, and
succeeded as wonderfully as Dickens succeeded in painting certain
classes of London life.&nbsp; Now, assuredly, I should have never
dreamt of instituting a comparison of this kind between two of
the most delightful writers and the most delightful men that have
lived in my time had not critics been doing so to the
disparagement of one of them.&nbsp; But if one of these writers
must be set up against another, I feel that something should be
said upon the other side of the question&mdash;I feel that
something should be said on those points where the American had
the advantage.&nbsp; Take the question of atmosphere, for
instance.&nbsp; Let us not forget how enormously important is
atmosphere in any imaginative picture of life.&nbsp; Without
going so far as to say that atmosphere is as important, or nearly
as important, as character, let me ask, What was it that captured
the readers of &lsquo;Robinson Crusoe&rsquo;?&nbsp; Was it the
character of Defoe&rsquo;s hero, or was it the scenery and the
atmosphere in which he placed him?&nbsp; Again, see what an
important part scenery and atmosphere played in &lsquo;The Lay of
the Last Minstrel,&rsquo; in &lsquo;The Lady of the Lake,&rsquo;
in &lsquo;Marmion,&rsquo; and in &lsquo;Waverley.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And surely it was the atmosphere of Byron&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Giaour,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Bride of Abydos,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;The Corsair,&rsquo; that mainly gave <a
name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 308</span>these poems
their vogue.&nbsp; And, in a certain sense, it may be said that
Dickens gave to his readers a new atmosphere, for he was the
first to explore what was something new to the reading
world&mdash;the great surging low-life of London and the life of
the lower stratum of its middle class.&nbsp; It seems that the
pure novelist of manners only can dispense with a new and
picturesque atmosphere.&nbsp; It was natural for England to look
to American writers to enrich English literature with a new
imaginative atmosphere, and she did not look in vain.&nbsp; But,
notwithstanding all that had been done by writers like Brockden
Brown, Fenimore Cooper, Dr. Bird, and others to bring American
atmosphere into literature, Bret Harte gave us an atmosphere that
was American and yet as new as though the above-mentioned writers
had never written.&nbsp; He had the advantage of depicting a
scenery that was as unlike the backwoods of his predecessors as
it was unlike everything else in the world.&nbsp; It is doubtful
whether there is any scenery in the world so fascinating as the
mountain ranges of the Pacific side of the United States and
Canada.</p>
<p>Every one is born with an instinct for loving some particular
kind of scenery, and this bias has not so much to do with the
birth-environment as is generally supposed.&nbsp; It would have
been of no avail for Bret Harte to be familiar with the mighty
canons, peaks, and cataracts of the Nevada regions unless he had
had a natural genius for loving and depicting them; and this,
undoubtedly, he had, as we see by the effect upon us of his
descriptions.&nbsp; Once read, his pictures are never
forgotten.&nbsp; But it was not merely that the scenery and
atmosphere of Bret Harte&rsquo;s stories are new&mdash;the point
is that the social mechanism in which his characters move is also
new.&nbsp; And if it cannot be denied that in temperament his
characters are allied to the characters of Dickens, we <a
name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 309</span>must not
make too much of this.&nbsp; Notwithstanding all the freshness
and newness of Dickens&rsquo;s characters they were entirely the
slaves of English sanctions.&nbsp; Those incongruities which gave
them their humourous side arose from their contradicting the
English social sanctions around them.&nbsp; But in Bret
Harte&rsquo;s Argonauts we get characters that move entirely
outside those sanctions of civilization with which the reader is
familiar.&nbsp; And this is why the violent contrasts in his
stories seem, somehow, to be better authenticated than do the
equally violent contrasts in Dickens&rsquo;s stories.&nbsp; Bret
Harte&rsquo;s characters are amenable to no laws except the
improvised laws of the camp; and the final arbiter is either the
six-shooter or the rope of Judge Lynch.&nbsp; And yet underlying
this apparent lawlessness there is that deep
&lsquo;law-abidingness&rsquo; which the late Grant Allen despised
as being &lsquo;the Anglo-Saxon characteristic.&rsquo;&nbsp; To
my mind, indeed, there is nothing so new, fresh, and piquant in
the fiction of my time as Bret Harte&rsquo;s pictures of the
mixed race we call Anglo-Saxon finding itself right outside all
the old sanctions, exercising nevertheless its own peculiar
instinct for law-abidingness of a kind.</p>
<p>We get the Anglo-Saxon beginning life anew far removed from
the old sanctions of civilization, retaining of necessity a good
deal of that natural liberty which, according to Blackstone, was
surrendered by the first human compact in order to secure its
substitute, civil liberty.&nbsp; We get vivid pictures of the
racial qualities which enable the Anglo-Saxon to plant his roots
and flourish in almost every square mile of the New World that
lies in the temperate zone.&nbsp; Let a group of this great race
of universal squatters be the dwellers in Roaring Camp, or a
party of whalers in New Zealand when it is a &lsquo;no
man&rsquo;s land,&rsquo; or even a gang of mutineers from <a
name="page310"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 310</span>the Bounty,
it is all one as regards their methods as squatters.&nbsp; The
moment that the mutineers set foot on Pitcairn Island they
improvise a code of laws something like the camp laws of Bret
Harte&rsquo;s Argonauts, and the code on the whole works
well.</p>
<p>Therefore I think that, apart altogether from the literary
excellence of the presentation, Bret Harte&rsquo;s pictures of
the Anglo-Saxon in these conditions will, even as documents, pass
into literature.&nbsp; And again, year by year, as nature is
being more and more studied, are what I may call the open-air
qualities of literature being more sought after.&nbsp; This
accounts in a large measure for the growing interest in a writer
once strangely neglected, George Borrow; and if there should be
any diminution in the great and deserved vogue of Dickens, it
will be because he is not strong in open-air qualities.</p>
<p>Bret Harte&rsquo;s stories give the reader a sense of the open
air second only to Borrow&rsquo;s own pictures.&nbsp; And if I am
right in thinking that the love of nature and the love of
open-air life are growing, this also will secure a place in the
future for Bret Harte.</p>
<p>And now what about his power of creating new
characters&mdash;not characters of the soil merely, but dramatic
characters?&nbsp; Well, here one cannot speak with quite so much
confidence on behalf of Bret Harte; and here he showed his great
inferiority to Dickens.&nbsp; Dickens, of course, used a larger
canvas&mdash;gave himself more room to depict his subjects.</p>
<p>If Bret Harte&rsquo;s scenes and characters seem somewhat
artificial, may it not be often accounted for by the fact that he
wrote short stories and not long novels?&nbsp; For it is very
difficult in a short story to secure the freedom and flexibility
of movement which belong to nature&mdash;the last perfection of
imaginative art.</p>
<p><a name="page311"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 311</span>All
artistic imitations of nature, of course, consist of
selection.&nbsp; In actual life we form our own picture of a
character not by having the traits selected for us and presented
to us in a salient way, as in art, but by selecting in a
semi-conscious way for ourselves from the great mass of
characteristics presented to us by nature.&nbsp; The shorter the
story, the more economic must be its methods, and hence the more
rigid must its selection of characteristics be; and this, of
course, is apt to give an air of artificiality to a short story
from which a long novel may be free.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is impossible within the space
at my command to follow Mr. Watts-Dunton into Wales, or through
those Continental journeys described by Dr. Hake in &lsquo;The
New Day.&rsquo;&nbsp; I can best show the impression that Alpine
scenery made upon him by quoting further on the end of &lsquo;The
Coming of Love.&rsquo;&nbsp; But with regard to Wales, it seems
necessary that a word or two should be said, for it is a fact
that the Welsh nation has accepted &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; as the
representative Welsh novel.&nbsp; And this is not surprising,
because, as many Welsh writers have averred, Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s passionate sympathy for Wales is as sincere
as though he had been born upon her soil.&nbsp; The
&lsquo;Arvon&rsquo; edition is thus dedicated:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To Ernest Rhys, poet and romancist, and my
very dear friend, this edition of &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; is
affectionately inscribed.</p>
<p>It was as far back as those summer days when you used to read
the proofs of &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo;&mdash;used to read them in the
beautiful land the story endeavours to depict&mdash;that the wish
came to me to inscribe it to you, whose paraphrases of &lsquo;The
Lament of Llywarch H&euml;n,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Lament of
Urien,&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Song of the Graves&rsquo; have so
entirely caught the old music of Kymric romance.</p>
<p>When I described my Welsh heroine as showing that &lsquo;love
of the wind&rsquo; which is such a fascinating characteristic <a
name="page313"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 313</span>of the
Snowdonian girls I had only to recall that poetic triumph, your
paraphrase of Taliesin&rsquo;s &lsquo;Song of the
Wind&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>Oh, most beautiful One!<br />
In the wood and in the mead,<br />
How he fares in his speed!<br />
And over the land,<br />
Without foot, without hand,<br />
Without fear of old age,<br />
Or Destiny&rsquo;s rage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * *</p>
<p>His banner he flings<br />
O&rsquo;er the earth as he springs<br />
On his way, but unseen<br />
Are its folds; and his mien,<br />
Rough or fair, is not shown,<br />
And his face is unknown.</p>
<p>Had I anticipated that &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; would achieve a
great success among the very people for whom I wrote it, I should
without hesitation have asked you to accept the dedication at
that time.&nbsp; But I felt that it would seem like endeavouring
to take a worldly advantage of your friendship to ask your
permission to do this&mdash;to ask you to stand literary sponsor,
as it were, to a story depicting Wales and the great Kymric race
with which the name of Rhys is so memorably and so grandly
associated.&nbsp; For although my heart had the true
&lsquo;Kymric beat&rsquo;&mdash;if love of Wales may be taken as
an indication of that &lsquo;beat&rsquo;&mdash;the privilege of
having been born on the sacred soil of the Druids could not be
claimed by me, and I feared that in the vital presentation of
that organic detail, which is the first requisite in all true
imaginative art, I might in some degree be found wanting.&nbsp;
You yourself always prophesied, I remember, that
&lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; <a name="page314"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 314</span>would win the hearts of your
countrymen and countrywomen; but I knew your generous nature; I
knew also if I may say it, your affection for me.&nbsp; How could
I then help feeling that the kind wish was father to the kind
thought?</p>
<p>But now that your prophecies have come true, now that there
is, if I am to accept the words of another Welsh writer,
&lsquo;scarcely any home in Wales where a well-thumbed copy of
&ldquo;Aylwin&rdquo; is not to be found,&rsquo; and now that
thousands of Welsh women and Welsh girls have read, and, as I
know by letters from strangers, have smiled and wept over the
story of their countrywoman, Winifred Wynne, I feel that the time
has come when I may look for the pleasure of associating your
name with the book.</p>

<blockquote><p>Sometimes I have been asked whether Winifred Wynne
is not an idealised Welsh girl; but never by you, who know the
characteristics of the race to which you belong&mdash;know it far
too well to dream of asking that question.&nbsp; There are not
many people, I think, who know the Kymric race so intimately as I
do; and I have said on a previous occasion what I fully meant and
mean, that, although I have seen a good deal of the races of
Europe, I put the Kymric race in many ways at the top of them
all.&nbsp; They combine, as I think, the poetry, the music, the
instinctive love of the fine arts, and the humour of the other
Celtic peoples with the practicalness and bright-eyed sagacity of
the very different race to which they are so closely linked by
circumstance&mdash;the race whom it is the fashion to call the
Anglo-Saxon.&nbsp; And as to the charm of the Welsh girls, no one
who knows them as you and I do can fail to be struck by it
continually.&nbsp; Winifred Wynne I meant to be the typical Welsh
girl as I have found her&mdash;affectionate, warm-hearted, <a
name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
315</span>self-sacrificing, and brave.&nbsp; And I only wish that
my power to do justice to her and to the country that gave her
birth had been more adequate.&nbsp; There are, however, writers
now among you whose pictures of Welsh scenery and Welsh life can
hold their own with almost anything in contemporary fiction; and
to them I look for better work than mine in the same rich
field.&nbsp; Although I am familiar with the Alps and the other
mountain ranges of Europe, in their wildest and most beautiful
recesses, no hill scenery has for me the peculiar witchery of
that around Eryri.&nbsp; And what race in Europe has a history so
poetic, so romantic, and so pathetic as yours?&nbsp; That such a
country, so beautiful in every aspect, and surrounded by such an
atmosphere of poetry, will soon give birth to its Walter Scott is
with me a matter of fervid faith.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As to the descriptions of North Wales in &lsquo;Aylwin,&rsquo;
they are now almost classic; especially the descriptions of the
Swallow Falls and the Fairy Glen.&nbsp; Long before
&lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; was published, Welsh readers had been
delighted with the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; article
containing the description of Mr. Watts-Dunton and Sinfi Lovell
walking up the Capel Curig side of Snowdon at break of day.</p>
<p>Fine as is that description of a morning on Snowdon, it is not
finer than the description of a Snowdon sunset, which forms the
nobly symbolic conclusion of &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We were now at the famous spot where the
triple echo is best heard, and we began to shout like two
children in the direction of Llyn Ddu&rsquo;r Arddu.&nbsp; And
then our talk naturally fell on Knockers&rsquo; Llyn and the
echoes <a name="page316"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
316</span>to be heard there.&nbsp; She then took me to another
famous sight on this side of Snowdon, the enormous stone, said to
be five thousand tons in weight, called the Knockers&rsquo;
Anvil.&nbsp; While we lingered here Winnie gave me as
many-anecdotes and legends of this stone as would fill a little
volume.&nbsp; But suddenly she stopped.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look!&rsquo; she said, pointing to the sunset.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I have seen that sight only once before.&nbsp; I was with
Sinfi.&nbsp; She called it &ldquo;The Dukkeripen of the
Tr&uacute;shul.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>The sun was now on the point of sinking, and his radiance,
falling on the cloud-pageantry of the zenith, fired the flakes
and vapoury films floating and trailing above, turning them at
first into a ruby-coloured mass, and then into an ocean of rosy
fire.&nbsp; A horizontal bar of cloud which, until the radiance
of the sunset fell upon it, had been dull and dark and grey, as
though a long slip from the slate quarries had been laid across
the west, became for a moment a deep lavender colour, and then
purple, and then red-gold.&nbsp; But what Winnie was pointing at
was a dazzling shaft of quivering fire where the sun had now sunk
behind the horizon.&nbsp; Shooting up from the cliffs where the
sun had disappeared, this shaft intersected the bar of clouds and
seemed to make an irregular cross of deep rose.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is no wonder, therefore, that the path Henry Aylwin and
Sinfi Lovell took on the morning when the search for Winifred
began was a source of speculation, notably in &lsquo;Notes and
Queries.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Watts-Dunton deals with this point in
the preface to the twenty-second edition:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;in regard
to &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; has given me so much pleasure as the way
in which it has been received <a name="page317"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 317</span>both by my Welsh friends and my
Romany friends.&nbsp; I little thought, when I wrote it, that
within three years of its publication the gypsy pictures in it
would be discoursed upon to audiences of 4,000 people by a man so
well equipped to express an opinion on such a subject as the
eloquent and famous &lsquo;Gypsy Smith,&rsquo; and described by
him as &lsquo;the most trustworthy picture of Romany life in the
English language, containing in Sinfi Lovell the truest
representative of the Gypsy girl.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Since the first appearance of the book there have been many
interesting discussions by Welsh readers, in various periodicals,
upon the path taken by Sinfi Lovell and Aylwin in their ascent of
Snowdon.</p>
<p>A very picturesque letter appeared in &lsquo;Notes and
Queries&rsquo; on May 3, 1902, signed C. C. B., in answer to a
query by E. W., which I will give myself the pleasure of quoting
because it describes the writer&rsquo;s ascent of Snowdon
(accompanied by a son of my old friend, Harry Owen, late of
Pen-y-Gwryd) along a path which was almost the same as that taken
by Aylmin and Sinfi Lovell, when he saw the same magnificent
spectacle that was seen by them:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The mist was then clearing (it was in July) and in a
few moments was entirely gone.&nbsp; So marvellous a
transformation scene, and so immense a prospect, I have never
beheld since.&nbsp; For the first and only time in my life I saw
from one spot almost the whole of North and Mid-Wales, a good
part of Western England, and a glimpse of Scotland and
Ireland.&nbsp; The vision faded all too quickly, but it was worth
walking thirty-three or thirty-four miles, as I did that day, for
even a briefer view than that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Referring to Llyn Coblynau, this interesting writer
says:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only from Glaslyn would the description in
&ldquo;Aylwin&rdquo; <a name="page318"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 318</span>of y Wyddfa standing out against the
sky &ldquo;as narrow and as steep as the sides of an acorn&rdquo;
be correct, but from the north and north-west sides of Glaslyn
this answers with quite curious exactness to the appearance of
the mountain.&nbsp; We must suppose the action of the story to
have taken place before the revival of the copper-mining industry
on Snowdon.&rsquo;</p>

<blockquote><p>With regard, however, to the question here raised,
I can save myself all trouble by simply quoting the admirable
remarks of Sion o Ddyli in the same number of &lsquo;Notes and
Queries&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;None of us are very likely to succeed in
&ldquo;placing&rdquo; this llyn, because the author of
&ldquo;Aylwin,&rdquo; taking a privilege of romance often taken
by Sir Walter Scott before him, probably changed the landmarks in
idealising the scene and adapting it to his story.&nbsp; It may
be, indeed, that the Welsh name given to the llyn in the book is
merely a rough translation of the gipsies&rsquo; name for it, the
&ldquo;Knockers&rdquo; being gnomes or goblins of the mine; hence
&ldquo;Coblynau&rdquo;&mdash;goblins.&nbsp; If so, the name
itself can give us no clue unless we are lucky enough to secure
the last of the Welsh gipsies for a guide.&nbsp; In any case, the
only point from which to explore Snowdon for the small llyn, or
perhaps llyns (of which Llyn Coblynau is a kind of composite
ideal picture), is no doubt, as E. W. has suggested, Capel Curig;
and I imagine the actual scene lies about a mile south from
Glaslyn, while it owes something at least of its colouring in the
book to that strange lake.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Knockers,&rdquo; it
must be remembered, usually depend upon the existence of a mine
near by, with old partly fallen mine-workings where the dropping
of water or other subterranean noises produce the curious
phenomenon which is turned to such imaginative account in the
Snowdon chapters of &ldquo;Aylwin.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page319"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 319</span>In
&lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; Mr. Watts-Dunton is fond of giving his
readers little pictorial glimpses of Welsh life:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The peasants and farmers all knew me.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Sut mae dy galon? (How is thy heart?)&rsquo; they would
say in the beautiful Welsh phrase as I met them.&nbsp; &lsquo;How
is my heart, indeed!&rsquo;&nbsp; I would sigh as I went on my
way.</p>
<p>Before I went to Wales in search of Winifred I had never set
foot in the Principality.&nbsp; Before I left it there was
scarcely a Welshman who knew more familiarly than I every mile of
the Snowdonian country.&nbsp; Never a trace of Winifred could I
find.</p>
<p>At the end of the autumn I left the cottage and removed to
Pen-y-Gwryd, as a comparatively easy point from which I could
reach the mountain llyn where I had breakfasted with Winifred on
that morning.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His intense affection for Welsh characteristics is seen in the
following description of the little Welsh girl and her
fascinating lisp:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Would you like to come in our
garden?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s such a nice garden.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I could resist her no longer.&nbsp; That voice would have
drawn me had she spoken in the language of the Toltecs or the
lost Zamzummin.&nbsp; To describe it would of course be
impossible.&nbsp; The novelty of her accent, the way in which she
gave the &lsquo;h&rsquo; in &lsquo;which,&rsquo;
&lsquo;what,&rsquo; and &lsquo;when,&rsquo; the Welsh rhythm of
her intonation, were as bewitching to me as the timbre of her
voice.&nbsp; And let me say here, once for all, that when I sat
down to write this narrative, I determined to give the English
reader some idea of the way in which, whenever her emotions were
deeply touched, her talk would run into soft Welsh <a
name="page320"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
320</span>diminutives; but I soon abandoned the attempt in
despair.&nbsp; I found that to use colloquial Welsh with effect
in an English context is impossible without wearying English
readers and disappointing Welsh ones.</p>
<p>Here, indeed, is one of the great disadvantages under which
this book will go out to the world.&nbsp; While a story-teller
may reproduce, by means of orthographical devices, something of
the effect of Scottish accent, Irish accent, or Manx accent, such
devices are powerless to represent Welsh accent.&rdquo;</p>

IMAGINATIVE AND DIDACTIC PROSE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">But</span> the interesting subjects
touched upon in the last four chapters have led me far from the
subject of &lsquo;The Renascence of Wonder.&rsquo;&nbsp; In its
biographical sketch of Mr. Watts-Dunton the
&lsquo;Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica&rsquo; says:
&ldquo;Imaginative glamour and mysticism are prominent
characteristics both of &lsquo;The Coming of Love&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Aylwin,&rsquo; and the novel in particular has had its
share in restoring the charms of pure romance to the favour of
the general public.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is high praise, but I hope
to show that it is deserved.&nbsp; When it was announced that a
work of prose fiction was about to be published by the critic of
the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um,&rsquo; what did Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s readers expect?&nbsp; I think they expected
something as unlike what the story turned out to be as it is
possible to imagine.&nbsp; They expected a story built up of a
discursive sequence of new and profound generalizations upon life
and literature expressed in brilliant picturesque prose such as
had been the delight of my boyhood in Ireland; they expected to
be fascinated more than ever by that &lsquo;easy authoritative
greatness and comprehensiveness of style&rsquo; with which they
had been familiar for long; they expected also that subtle irony
after the fashion of Fielding, which suggests so much between the
lines, that humour which had been an especial joy to me in <a
name="page322"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 322</span>scores of
articles signed by the writer&rsquo;s style as indubitably as if
they had been signed by his name.&nbsp; I think everybody
cherished this expectation: everybody took it for granted that
heaps of those &lsquo;intellectual nuggets&rsquo; about which
Minto talked would smother the writer as a story-teller, that the
book as literature would be admirable&mdash;but as a novel a
failure.&nbsp; Great as was Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s esoteric
reputation, I believe that many of the booksellers declined (as
the author had prophesied that they would decline) to subscribe
for the book.&nbsp; They expected it to fail as a marketable
novel&mdash;to fail in that &lsquo;artistic convincement&rsquo;
of which Mr. Watts-Dunton has himself so often written.&nbsp;
What neither I nor any one else save those who, like Mr.
Swinburne, had read the story in manuscript, did expect, was a
story so poetic, so unworldly, and so romantic that it might have
been written by a young Celt&mdash;a love story of intense
passion, which yet by some magic art was as convincingly
realistic as any one of those &lsquo;flat-footed&rsquo;
sermon-stories which the late W. E. Henley was wont to
deride.</p>
<p>In fact, from this point of view &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; is a
curiosity of literature.&nbsp; The truth seems to be, however,
that, as one of Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s most intimate friends
has said, its style represents one facet only of
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s character.&nbsp; Like most of us, he has a
dual existence&mdash;one half of him is the romantic youth, Henry
Aylwin, the other half is the world-wise philosopher of the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um.&rsquo;&nbsp; This other half of him lives
in the style of another story altogether, where the creator of
Henry Aylwin takes up the very different role of a man of the
world.&nbsp; Now I have views of my own upon this duality.&nbsp;
I think that if the brilliant worldly writing of the mass of his
work be examined, it will be found to be a &lsquo;shot&rsquo;
texture scintillating with various hues <a
name="page323"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 323</span>where
sometimes repressed passion and sometimes mysticism and dreams
are constantly shining through the glossy silk of the
style.&nbsp; Sometimes from the smooth, even flow of the
criticisms gleams of a passion far more intense than anything in
&lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; will flash out.&nbsp; I will cite a passage
in his critical writings wherein he discusses the inadequacy of
language to express the deepest passion:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As compared with sculpture and painting the
great infirmity of poetry, as an &lsquo;imitation&rsquo; of
nature, is of course that the medium is always and of necessity
words&mdash;even when no words could, in the dramatic situation,
have been spoken.&nbsp; It is not only Homer who is obliged
sometimes to forget that passion when at white heat is never
voluble, is scarcely even articulate; the dramatists also are
obliged to forget that in love and in hate, at their tensest,
words seem weak and foolish when compared with the silent and
satisfying triumph and glory of deeds, such as the plastic arts
can render.&nbsp; This becomes manifest enough when we compare
the Niobe group or the Laocoon group, or the great dramatic
paintings of the modern world, with even the finest efforts of
dramatic poetry, such as the speech of Andromache to Hector, or
the speech of Priam to Achilles; nay, such as even the cries of
Cassandra in the &lsquo;Agamemnon,&rsquo; or the wailings of Lear
over the dead Cordelia.&nbsp; Even when writing the words uttered
by &OElig;dipus, as the terrible truth breaks in upon his soul,
Sophocles must have felt that, in the holiest chambers of sorrow
and in the highest agonies of suffering reigns that awful silence
which not poetry, but painting sometimes, and sculpture always,
can render.&nbsp; What human sounds could render the agony of
Niobe, or the agony of Laocoon, as we see them in the
sculptor&rsquo;s <a name="page324"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
324</span>rendering?&nbsp; Not articulate speech at all; not
words, but wails.&nbsp; It is the same with hate; it is the same
with love.&nbsp; We are not speaking merely of the unpacking of
the heart in which the angry warriors of the &lsquo;Ilaid&rsquo;
indulge.&nbsp; Even such subtle writing as that of &AElig;schylus
and Sophocles falls below the work of the painter.&nbsp; Hate,
though voluble perhaps as Clyt&aelig;mnestra&rsquo;s when hate is
at that red-heat glow which the poet can render, changes in a
moment whenever that redness has been fanned into hatred&rsquo;s
own last complexion&mdash;whiteness as of iron at the
melting-point&mdash;when the heart has grown far too big to be
&lsquo;unpacked&rsquo; at all, and even the bitter epigrams of
hate&rsquo;s own rhetoric, though brief as the terrier&rsquo;s
snap before he fleshes his teeth, or as the short snarl of the
tigress as she springs before her cubs in danger, are all too
slow and sluggish for a soul to which language at its tensest has
become idle play.&nbsp; But this is just what cannot be rendered
by an art whose medium consists solely of words.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could any one reading this passage doubt that the real work of
the writer was to write poetry and not criticism?</p>
<p>But this makes it necessary for me to say a word upon the
question of the style of &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo;&mdash;a question
that has often been discussed.&nbsp; The fascination of the story
is largely due to the magnetism of its style.&nbsp; And yet how
undecorated, not to say how plain, the style in the more level
passages often is!&nbsp; When the story was first written the
style glittered with literary ornament.&nbsp; But the author
deliberately struck out many of the poetic passages.&nbsp;
Coleridge tells us that an imaginative work should be written in
a simple style, and that the more imaginative the work the
simpler the style should be.&nbsp; I often think of these words
when I labour in the sweat of my brow to <a
name="page325"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 325</span>read the
word-twisting of precious writers!&nbsp; It is then that I think
of &lsquo;Aylwin,&rsquo; for &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; stands alone in
its power of carrying the reader away to climes of new and rare
beauty peopled by characters as new and as rare.&nbsp; It was
clearly Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s idea that what such a story
needed was mastery over &lsquo;artistic
convincement.&rsquo;&nbsp; He has more than once commented on the
acuteness of Edgar Poe&rsquo;s remark that in the expression of
true passion there is always something of the
&lsquo;homely.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; is one long
unbroken cry of passion, mostly in a &lsquo;homely key,&rsquo;
but this &lsquo;homely key&rsquo; is left for loftier keys
whenever the proper time for the change comes.&nbsp; In beginning
to write, the author seems to have felt that &lsquo;The
Renascence of Wonder&rsquo; and the quest of beauty, although
adequately expressed in the poetry of the newest romantic
school&mdash;that of Rossetti, Morris, and Swinburne&mdash;had
only found its way into imaginative prose through the highly
elaborate technique of his friend, George Meredith.&nbsp; He
seems to have felt that the great imaginative prose writers of
the time, Thackeray, Dickens, and Charles Reade, were in a
certain sense Philistines of genius who had done but little to
bring beauty, romance and culture into prose fiction.&nbsp; And
as to Meredith, though a true child of romanticism who never did
and never could breathe the air of Philistia, he had adopted a
style too self-conscious and rich in literary qualities to touch
that great English pulse that beats outside the walls of the
Palace of Art.</p>
<p>Mrs. Craigie has lately declared that at the present moment
all the most worthy English novelists, with the exception of Mr.
Thomas Hardy, are distinguished disciples of Mr. George
Meredith.&nbsp; But to belong to &lsquo;the mock
Meredithians&rsquo; is not a matter of very great glory.&nbsp; No
one adores the work of Mr. Meredith <a name="page326"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 326</span>more than I do, though my admiration
is not without a certain leaven of distress at his literary
self-consciousness.&nbsp; I say this with all reverence.&nbsp;
Great as Meredith is, he would be greater still if, when he is
delivering his priceless gifts to us, he would bear in mind that
immortal injunction in &lsquo;King Henry the
Fourth&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I prithee now, deliver them like a man
of this world.&rsquo;&nbsp; I can imagine how the great humourist
must smile when the dolt, who once found &lsquo;obscurity&rsquo;
in his most lucid passages, praises him for the defects of his
qualities, and calls upon all other writers to write
Meredithese.</p>
<p>To be a classic&mdash;to be immortal&mdash;it is necessary for
an imaginative writer to deliver his message like &lsquo;a man of
this world.&rsquo;&nbsp; Shakespeare himself, occasionally, will
seem to forget this, but only occasionally, and we never think of
it when falling down in worship before the shrine of the greatest
imaginative writer that has ever lived.&nbsp; Dr. Johnson said
that all work which lives is without eccentricity.&nbsp; Now,
entranced as I have been, ever since I was a boy, by
Meredith&rsquo;s incomparable romances, I long to set my
imagination free of Meredith and fly away with his characters, as
I can fly away with the characters of the classic imaginative
writers from Homer down to Sir Walter Scott.&nbsp; But I seldom
succeed.&nbsp; Now and then I escape from the obsession of the
picture of the great writer seated in his chalet with the summer
sunshine gleaming round his picturesque head, but illuminating
also all too vividly his inkstand, and his paper and his pens;
but only now and then, and not for long.&nbsp; If it had pleased
Nature to give him less intellectual activity, less humour and
wit and literary brilliance, I feel sure that he would have lived
more securely as an English classic.&nbsp; I adore him, I say,
and although I do not know him personally, I love him.&nbsp; We
all love him: and when <a name="page327"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 327</span>I am in a very charitable mood, I
can even forgive him for having begotten the &lsquo;mock
Meredithians.&rsquo;&nbsp; As to those who, without a spark of
his humourous imagination and supple intellect can manage to
mimic his style, if they only knew what a torture their
word-twisting is to the galled reviewer who wants to get on, and
to know what on earth they have got to tell him, I think they
would display a little more mercy, and even for pity&rsquo;s sake
deliver their gifts like &lsquo;men of this world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; Mr. Watts-Dunton seems to have
determined to be as romantic and as beautiful as the romanticists
in poetry had ever dared to be, and yet by aid of a simplicity
and a na&iuml;vet&eacute; of diction of which his critical
writings had shown no sign, to carry his beautiful dreams into
Philistia itself.&nbsp; Never was there a bolder enterprise, and
never was there a greater success.&nbsp; That
&lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; would appeal strongly to imaginative minds
was certain, for it was written by &lsquo;the most widely
cultivated writer in the English belles lettres of our
time.&rsquo;&nbsp; But the strange thing is that a story so full
of romance, poetry, and beauty, should also appeal to other
minds.</p>
<p>I am no believer in mere popularity, and I confess that when
books come before me for review I cannot help casting a
suspicious eye upon any story by any of the very popular
novelists of the day.&nbsp; But it is necessary to explain why
the most poetical romance written within the last century is also
one of the most popular.&nbsp; It was in part owing to its
simplicity of diction, its na&iuml;vet&eacute; of utterance, and
its freedom from superfluous literary ornamentation.&nbsp; I do
not as a rule like using a foreign word when an English word will
do the same work, but neither &lsquo;artlessness,&rsquo;
&lsquo;candour&rsquo; nor &lsquo;simplicity&rsquo; seem to
express the unique charm of the style of &lsquo;Aylwin,&rsquo; so
completely <a name="page328"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
328</span>as does the word
&lsquo;na&iuml;vet&eacute;.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was by
na&iuml;vet&eacute;, I believe, that he carried the Renascence of
Wonder into quarters which his great brothers in the Romantic
movement could never reach.</p>
<p>For such a writer as he, the critic steeped in all the latest
subtleties of the style of to-day, and indeed the originator of
many of these subtleties, the intimate friend of such superb and
elaborate literary artists as Tennyson, Browning, George
Meredith, Rossetti and Swinburne, it must have been inconceivably
difficult to write the &lsquo;working portions&rsquo; of his
narrative in a style as unbookish at times as if he had written
in the pre-Meredithian epoch.&nbsp; Having set out to convince
his readers of the truth of what he was telling them, he
determined to sacrifice all literary
&lsquo;self-indulgence&rsquo; to that end.&nbsp; I do not
recollect that any critic, when the book came out, noted
this.&nbsp; But if &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; had been a French book
published in France, the na&iuml;ve style adopted by the
autobiographer would have been recognized by the critics as the
crowning proof of the author&rsquo;s dramatic genius.&nbsp;
Whenever the style seems most to suggest the pre-Meredithian
writers, it is because the story is an autobiography and because
the hero lived in pre-Meredithian times.&nbsp; Difficult as was
Thackeray&rsquo;s tour de force in &lsquo;Esmond,&rsquo; it was
nothing to the tour de force of &lsquo;Aylwin.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
tale is told &lsquo;as though inspired by the very spirit of
youth&rsquo; because the hero was a youth when he told it.&nbsp;
It is hard to imagine a writer past the meridian of life being
able to write a story &lsquo;more flushed with the glory and the
passion and the wonder of youth than any other in English
fiction.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It should be noted that whenever the incidents become
especially tragic or romantic or weird or poetic, the
&lsquo;homeliness&rsquo; of the style goes&mdash;the style at
once rises <a name="page329"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
329</span>to the occasion, it becomes not only rich, but too rich
for prose.&nbsp; I have now and then heard certain word-twisters
of second-hand Meredithese speak of the &lsquo;baldness&rsquo; of
the style of &lsquo;Aylwin.&rsquo;&nbsp; Roll fifty of these
word-twisters into one, and let that one write a sentence or two
of such prose as this, published at the time that
&lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; was written.&nbsp; It occurs in a passage on
the greatest of all rich writers, Shakespeare:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the quality of richness Shakespeare
stood quite alone till the publication of
&lsquo;Endymion.&rsquo;&nbsp; Till then it was &lsquo;Eclipse
first&mdash;the rest nowhere.&rsquo;&nbsp; When we think of
Shakespeare, it is his richness more than even his higher
qualities that we think of first.&nbsp; In reading him, we feel
at every turn that we have come upon a mind as rich as
Marlowe&rsquo;s Moor, who</p>
<p>Without control can pick his riches up,<br />
And in his house heap pearls, like pebble-stones.</p>
<p>Nay, he is richer still; he can, by merely looking at the
&lsquo;pebble-stones,&rsquo; turn them into pearls for himself,
like the changeling child recovered from the gnomes in the
Rosicrucian story.&nbsp; His riches burden him.&nbsp; And no
wonder: it is stiff flying with the ruby hills of
Badakhsh&acirc;n on your back.&nbsp; Nevertheless, so strong are
the wings of his imagination, so lordly is his intellect, that he
can carry them all; he could carry, it would seem, every gem in
Golconda&mdash;every gem in every planet from here to
Neptune&mdash;and yet win his goal.&nbsp; Now, in the matter of
richness this is the great difference between him and Keats, the
wings of whose imagination, a&euml;rial at starting, and only
iridescent like the sails of a dragon-fly, seem to change as he
goes&mdash;become overcharged with beauty, in fact&mdash;abloom
&lsquo;with splendid dyes, as are the tiger-moth&rsquo;s
deep-damasked wings.&rsquo;&nbsp; Or, rather, it may be <a
name="page330"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 330</span>said that
he seems to start sometimes with Shakespeare&rsquo;s own
eagle-pinions, which, as he mounts, catch and retain colour after
colour from the earth below, till, heavy with beauty as the
drooping wings of a golden pheasant, they fly low and level at
last over the earth they cannot leave for its loveliness, not
even for the holiness of the skies.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will give a few instances of passages in
&lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; quite as rich as this.&nbsp; One shall be
from that scene in which Winifred unconsciously reveals to her
lover that her father has stolen the jewelled cross and brought
his own father&rsquo;s curse upon her beloved head:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Winifred picked up the sea weed and made a
necklace of it, in the old childish way, knowing how much it
would please me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a lovely colour?&rsquo; she said, as it
glistened in the moonlight.&nbsp; &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t it just as
beautiful and just as precious as if it were really made of the
jewels it seems to rival?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is as red as the reddest ruby,&rsquo; I replied,
putting out my hand and grasping the slippery substance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Would you believe,&rsquo; said Winnie, &lsquo;that I
never saw a ruby in my life?&nbsp; And now I particularly want to
know all about rubies.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why do you want particularly to know?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because,&rsquo; said Winifred, &lsquo;my father, when
he wished me to come out for a walk, had been talking a great
deal about rubies.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your father had been talking about rubies,
Winifred&mdash;how very odd!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Winifred, &lsquo;and he talked about
diamonds too.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">The Curse</span>!&rsquo; I
murmured, and clasped her to my breast.&nbsp; &lsquo;Kiss me,
Winifred!&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page331"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 331</span>There
had come a bite of sudden fire at my heart, and I shuddered with
a dreadful knowledge, like the captain of an unarmed ship, who,
while the unconscious landsmen on board are gaily scrutinizing a
sail that like a speck has appeared on the horizon, shudders with
the knowledge of what the speck is, and hears in imagination the
yells, and sees the knives, of the Lascar pirates just starting
in pursuit.&nbsp; As I took in the import of those innocent
words, falling from Winifred&rsquo;s bright lips, falling as
unconsciously as water-drops over a coral reef in tropical seas
alive with the eyes of a thousand sharks, my skin seemed to
roughen with dread, and my hair began to stir.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another instance occurs in Wilderspin&rsquo;s ornate
description of his great picture, &lsquo;Faith and
Love&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Imagine yourself standing in an
Egyptian city, where innumerable lamps of every hue are
shining.&nbsp; It is one of the great lamp-f&ecirc;tes of Sais,
which all Egypt has come to see.&nbsp; There, in honour of the
feast, sits a tall woman, covered by a veil.&nbsp; But the
painting is so wonderful, Mr. Aylwin, that, though you see a
woman&rsquo;s face expressed behind the veil&mdash;though you see
the warm flesh-tints and the light of the eyes through the
a&euml;rial film&mdash;you cannot judge of the character of the
face&mdash;you cannot see whether it is that of woman in her
noblest, or woman in her basest, type.&nbsp; The eyes sparkle,
but you cannot say whether they sparkle with malignity or
benevolence&mdash;whether they are fired with what Philip Aylwin
calls &ldquo;the love-light of the seventh heaven,&rdquo; or are
threatening with &ldquo;the hungry flames of the seventh
hell!&rdquo;&nbsp; There she sits in front of a portico, while,
asleep, with folded wings, is crouched on one side of her the <a
name="page332"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 332</span>figure of
Love, with rosy feathers, and on the other the figure of Faith,
with plumage of a deep azure.&nbsp; Over her head, on the
portico, are written the words:&mdash;&ldquo;I am all that hath
been, is, and shall be, and no mortal hath uncovered my
veil.&rdquo;&nbsp; The tinted lights falling on the group are
shed, you see, from the rainbow-coloured lamps of Sais, which are
countless.&nbsp; But in spite of all these lamps, Mr. Aylwin, no
mortal can see the face behind that veil.&nbsp; And why?&nbsp;
Those who alone could uplift it, the figures folded with
wings&mdash;Faith and Love&mdash;are fast asleep, at the great
Queen&rsquo;s feet.&nbsp; When Faith and Love are sleeping there,
what are the many-coloured lamps of science!&mdash;of what use
are they to the famished soul of man?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A striking idea!&rsquo; I exclaimed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your father&rsquo;s,&rsquo; replied Wilderspin, in a
tone of such reverence that one might have imagined my
father&rsquo;s spectre stood before him.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
symbolises that base Darwinian cosmogony which Carlyle spits at,
and the great and good John Ruskin scorns.&nbsp; But this design
is only the predella beneath the picture &ldquo;Faith and
Love.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now look at the picture itself, Mr.
Aylwin,&rsquo; he continued, as though it were upon an easel
before me.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are at Sais no longer: you are now,
as the architecture around you shows, in a Greek city by the
sea.&nbsp; In the light of innumerable lamps, torches, and wax
tapers, a procession is moving through the streets.&nbsp; You see
Isis, as Pelagia, advancing between two ranks, one of joyous
maidens in snow white garments, adorned with wreaths, and
scattering from their bosoms all kinds of dewy flowers; the other
of youths, playing upon pipes and flutes mixed with men with
shaven shining crowns, playing upon sistra of brass, silver, and
gold.&nbsp; Isis wears a Dorian tunic, fastened on her breast by
a tasselled knot,&mdash;<a name="page333"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 333</span>an azure-coloured tunic bordered
with silver stars,&mdash;and an upper garment of the colour of
the moon at moon-rise.&nbsp; Her head is crowned with a chaplet
of sea-flowers, and round her throat is a necklace of seaweeds,
wet still with sea-water, and shimmering with all the shifting
hues of the sea.&nbsp; On either side of her stand the awakened
angels, uplifting from her face a veil whose folds flow soft as
water over her shoulders and over the wings of Faith and
Love.&nbsp; A symbol of the true cosmogony which Philip Aylwin
gave to the world!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another instance I take from that scene in the crypt whither
Aylwin had been drawn against his will by the ancestral impulses
in his blood to replace the jewelled cross upon the breast of his
father:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Having, with much difficulty, opened the
door, I entered the crypt.&nbsp; The atmosphere, though not
noisome, was heavy, and charged with an influence that worked an
extraordinary effect upon my brain and nerves.&nbsp; It was as
though my personality were becoming dissipated, until at last it
was partly the reflex of ancestral experiences.&nbsp; Scarcely
had this mood passed before a sensation came upon me of being
fanned as if by clammy bat-like wings; and then the idea seized
me that the crypt scintillated with the eyes of a malignant
foe.&nbsp; It was as if the curse which, until I heard Winnie a
beggar singing in the street, had been to me but a collocation of
maledictory words, harmless save in their effect upon her
superstitious mind, had here assumed an actual corporeal
shape.&nbsp; In the uncertain light shed by the lantern, I seemed
to see the face of this embodied curse with an ever-changing
mockery of expression; at one moment wearing the features of my
father; at another, <a name="page334"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 334</span>those of Tom Wynne; at another the
leer of the old woman I had seen in Cyril&rsquo;s studio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is an illusion,&rsquo; I said, as I closed my
eyes to shut it out; &lsquo;it is an illusion, born of opiate
fumes or else of an over-taxed brain and an exhausted
stomach.&rsquo;&nbsp; Yet it disturbed me as much as if my reason
had accepted it as real.&nbsp; Against this foe I seemed to be
fighting towards my father&rsquo;s coffin as a dreamer fights
against a nightmare, and at last I fell over one of the heaps of
old Danish bones in a corner of the crypt.&nbsp; The candle fell
from my lantern, and I was in darkness.&nbsp; As I sat there I
passed into a semi-conscious state.&nbsp; I saw sitting at the
apex of a towering pyramid, built of phosphorescent human bones
that reached far, far above the stars, the &lsquo;Queen of Death,
Nin-ki-gal,&rsquo; scattering seeds over the earth below.&nbsp;
At the pyramid&rsquo;s base knelt the suppliant figure of a Sibyl
pleading with the Queen of Death:</p>
<p>What answer, O Nin-ki-gal?<br />
Have pity, O Queen of Queens!</p>
<p>I sprang up, struck a light and relit the candle, and soon
reached the coffin resting on a stone table.&nbsp; I found, on
examining it, that although it had been screwed down after the
discovery of the violation, the work had been so loosely done
that a few turns of the screwdriver were sufficient to set the
lid free.&nbsp; Then I paused; for to raise the loosened lid
(knowing as I did that it was only the blood&rsquo;s inherited
follies that had conquered my rationalism and induced me to
disturb the tomb) seemed to require the strength of a
giant.&nbsp; Moreover, the fantastic terror of old
Lantoff&rsquo;s story, which at another time would have made me
smile, also took bodily shape, and the picture of a dreadful
struggle at the edge of the cliff between <a
name="page335"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
335</span>Winnie&rsquo;s father and mine seemed to hang in the
air&mdash;a fascinating mirage of ghastly horror . . .</p>
<p>At last, by an immense effort of will, I closed my eyes and
pushed the lid violently on one side . . .</p>
<p>The &lsquo;sweet odours and divers kinds of spices&rsquo; of
the Jewish embalmer rose like a gust of incense&mdash;rose and
spread through the crypt like the sweet breath of a newborn
blessing, till the air of the charnel-house seemed laden with a
mingled odour of indescribable sweetness.&nbsp; Never had any
odour so delighted my senses; never had any sensuous influence so
soothed my soul.</p>
<p>While I stood inhaling the scents of opobalsam, and cinnamon
and myrrh, and wine of palm and oil of cedar, and all the other
spices of the Pharaohs, mingled in one strange aromatic cloud, my
personality seemed again to become, in part, the reflex of
ancestral experiences.</p>
<p>I opened my eyes.&nbsp; I looked into the coffin.&nbsp; The
face (which had been left by the embalmer exposed) confronted
mine.&nbsp; &lsquo;Fenella Stanley!&rsquo; I cried, for the great
transfigurer Death had written upon my father&rsquo;s brow that
self-same message which the passions of a thousand Romany
ancestors had set upon the face of her whose portrait hung in the
picture-gallery.&nbsp; And the rubies and diamonds and beryls of
the cross as it now hung upon my breast, catching the light of
the opened lantern in my left hand, shed over the features an
indescribable reflex hue of quivering rose.</p>
<p>Beneath his head I placed the silver casket: I hung the
hair-chain round his neck: I laid upon his breast the long-loved
memento of his love and the parchment scroll.</p>
<p>Then I sank down by the coffin, and prayed.&nbsp; I knew not
what or why.&nbsp; But never since the first human prayer was
breathed did there rise to heaven a supplication so incoherent
and so wild as mine.&nbsp; Then I rose, and laying <a
name="page336"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 336</span>my hand
upon my father&rsquo;s cold brow, I said: &lsquo;You have
forgiven me for all the wild words that I uttered in my long
agony.&nbsp; They were but the voice of intolerable misery
rebelling against itself.&nbsp; You, who suffered so
much&mdash;who know so well those flames burning at the
heart&rsquo;s core&mdash;those flames before which all the forces
of the man go down like prairie-grass before the fire and
wind&mdash;you have forgiven me.&nbsp; You who knew the meaning
of the wild word Love&mdash;you have forgiven your suffering son,
stricken like yourself.&nbsp; You have forgiven me, father, and
forgiven him, the despoiler of your tomb: you have removed the
curse, and his child&mdash;his innocent child&mdash;is
free.&rsquo; . . .</p>
<p>I replaced the coffin-lid, and screwing it down left the
crypt, so buoyant and exhilarated that I stopped in the
churchyard and asked myself: &lsquo;Do I, then, really believe
that she was under a curse?&nbsp; Do I really believe that my
restoring the amulet has removed it?&nbsp; Have I really come to
this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Throughout all these proceedings&mdash;yes, even amidst that
prayer to Heaven, amidst that impassioned appeal to my dead
father&mdash;had my reason been keeping up that scoffing at my
heart which I have before described.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My last instance shall be from D&rsquo;Arcy&rsquo;s letter, in
which he records the marvellous events that led to his meeting
with Winifred:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And now, my dear Aylwin, having acted as a
somewhat prosaic reporter of these wonderful events, I should
like to conclude my letter with a word or two about what took
place when I parted from you in the streets of London.&nbsp; I
saw then that your sufferings had been very great, and since that
time they must have been tenfold greater.&nbsp; <a
name="page337"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 337</span>And now I
rejoice to think that, of all the men in this world who have ever
loved, you, through this very suffering, have been the most
fortunate.&nbsp; As Job&rsquo;s faith was tried by Heaven, so has
your love been tried by the power which you call
&lsquo;circumstance&rsquo; and which Wilderspin calls &lsquo;the
spiritual world.&rsquo;&nbsp; All that death has to teach the
mind and the heart of man you have learnt to the very full, and
yet she you love is restored to you, and will soon be in your
arms.&nbsp; I, alas! have long known that the tragedy of
tragedies is the death of a beloved mistress, or a beloved
wife.&nbsp; I have long known that it is as the King of Terrors
that Death must needs come to any man who knows what the word
&lsquo;love&rsquo; really means.&nbsp; I have never been a reader
of philosophy, but I understand that the philosophers of all
countries have been preaching for ages upon ages about
resignation to Death&mdash;about the final beneficence of
Death&mdash;that &lsquo;reasonable moderator and equipoise of
justice,&rsquo; as Sir Thomas Browne calls him.&nbsp; Equipoise
of justice indeed!&nbsp; He who can read with tolerance such
words as these must have known nothing of the true passion of
love for a woman as you and I understand it.&nbsp; The
Elizabethans are full of this nonsense; but where does
Shakespeare, with all his immense philosophical power, ever show
this temper of acquiescence?&nbsp; All his impeachments of Death
have the deep ring of personal feeling&mdash;dramatist though he
was.&nbsp; But, what I am going to ask you is, How shall the
modern materialist, who you think is to dominate the Twentieth
Century and all the centuries to follow&mdash;how shall he
confront Death when a beloved mistress is struck down?&nbsp; When
Moschus lamented that the mallow, the anise, and the parsley had
a fresh birth every year, whilst we men sleep in the hollow earth
a long, unbounded, never-waking sleep, he told us what your
modern materialist tells us, <a name="page338"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 338</span>and he re-echoed the lamentation
which, long before Greece had a literature at all, had been heard
beneath Chaldean stars and along the mud-banks of the Nile.&nbsp;
Your bitter experience made you ask materialism, What comfort is
there in being told that death is the very nursery of new life,
and that our heirs are our very selves, if when you take leave of
her who was and is your world it is &lsquo;Vale, vale, in
&aelig;ternum vale&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These quotations may be taken as specimens of the passages of
decorated writing which the author, in order to get closer to the
imagination of the reader, mercilessly struck out in proof.&nbsp;
Whether he did wisely or unwisely in striking them out is an
interesting question for criticism.</p>
<p>But certainly the reader has only to go through the book with
this criticism in his mind, and he will see that when the story
passes into such lofty speculation as that of the opening
sentences of the book, or into some equally lofty mood of the
love passion, the style becomes not only full of literary
qualities, but almost over-full; it becomes a style which can
best be described in his own words about richness of style which
I have quoted from the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um.&rsquo;&nbsp; I do
not doubt that Mr. Watts-Dunton was quite right in acting upon
Coleridge&rsquo;s theory; for, notwithstanding the
&lsquo;fairy-like beauty&rsquo; of the story it is as convincing
as a story told upon a prosaic subject by Defoe.&nbsp; In fact,
it would be hard to name any novel wherein those laws of means
and ends in art which Mr. Watts-Dunton has formulated in the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; are more fully observed than in
&lsquo;Aylwin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Madame Galimberti says in the &lsquo;Rivista
d&rsquo;Italia&rsquo;:&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; was
begun in verse, and was written in prose only when the plot,
taking, so to say, the poet by the <a name="page339"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 339</span>hand, showed the necessity of a form
more in keeping with the nature of the work; and in &lsquo;The
Coming of Love,&rsquo; in which the facts are condensed so as to
give full relief to the philosophical motive, the result is, in
my opinion, more perfect.&rdquo; <a name="citation339"></a><a
href="#footnote339" class="citation">[339]</a>&nbsp; My remarks
upon &lsquo;The Coming of Love&rsquo; will show that I agree with
the accomplished wife of the Italian Minister in placing it above
&lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; as a satisfactory work of art, but that is
because I consider &lsquo;The Coming of Love&rsquo; the most
important as well as the most original poem that has been
published for many years.</p>
<p>Madame Galimberti touches here upon a very important subject
for the literary student.&nbsp; I may say for myself that I have
invariably spoken of &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; as a poem, and I have
done so deliberately.&nbsp; Indeed, I think the fact that it is a
poem is at once its strength and its weakness.&nbsp; It does not
come under the critical canons that are applied to a prose novel
or romance.&nbsp; As a prose novel its one defect is that the
quest for mere beauty is pushed too far; lovely picture follows
lovely picture until the novel reader is inclined at last to cry,
&lsquo;Hold, enough!&rsquo;</p>
<p>In one of his essays on Morris, Mr. Watts-Dunton asks,
&lsquo;What is poetic prose?&rsquo;&nbsp; And then follows a
passage which must always be borne in mind when criticizing
&lsquo;Aylwin.&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;On no subject in literary criticism,&rdquo;
says he, &ldquo;has <a name="page340"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 340</span>there been a more persistent
misconception than upon this.&nbsp; What is called poetic prose
is generally rhetorical prose, and between rhetoric and poetry
there is a great difference.&nbsp; Poetical prose, we take it, is
that kind of prose which above all other kinds holds in suspense
the essential qualities of poetry.&nbsp; If &lsquo;eloquence is
heard and poetry overheard,&rsquo; where shall be placed the
tremendous perorations of De Quincey, or the sonorous and
highly-coloured descriptions of Ruskin?&nbsp; Grand and beautiful
are such periods as these, no doubt, but prose to be truly
poetical must move far away from them.&nbsp; It must, in a word,
have all the qualities of what we technically call poetry except
metre.&nbsp; We have, indeed, said before that while the
poet&rsquo;s object is to arouse in the listener an expectancy of
c&aelig;suric effects, the great goal before the writer of poetic
prose is in the very opposite direction; it is to make use of the
concrete figures and impassioned diction that are the
poet&rsquo;s vehicle, but at the same time to avoid the
expectancy of metrical bars.&nbsp; The moment that the regular
bars assert themselves and lead the reader&rsquo;s ears to expect
other bars of the like kind, sincerity ends.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Watts-Dunton himself has given us the best of all canons
for answering the question, &lsquo;What is a poem as
distinguished from other forms of imaginative
literature?&rsquo;&nbsp; In his essay on Poetry he
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Owing to the fact that the word
<i>&pi;&omicron;&iota;&eta;&tau;&#942;&sigmaf;</i> (first used to
designate the poetic artist by Herodotus) means maker, Aristotle
seems to have assumed that the indispensable basis of poetry is
invention.&nbsp; He appears to have thought that a poet is a poet
more on account of the composition of the action than on account
of the composition of his <a name="page341"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 341</span>verses.&nbsp; Indeed, he said as
much as this.&nbsp; Of epic poetry he declared emphatically that
it produces its imitations either by mere articulate words or by
metre superadded.&nbsp; This is to widen the definition of poetry
so as to include all imaginative literature, and Plato seems to
have given an equally wide meaning to the word
<i>&pi;&omicron;&#943;&eta;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;</i>.&nbsp; Only,
while Aristotle considered
<i>&pi;&omicron;&#943;&eta;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;</i> to be an
imitation of the facts of nature, Plato considered it to be an
imitation of the dreams of man.&nbsp; Aristotle ignored, and
Plato slighted, the importance of versification (though Plato on
one occasion admitted that he who did not know rhythm could be
called neither musician nor poet).&nbsp; It is impossible to
discuss here the question whether an imaginative work in which
the method is entirely concrete and the expression entirely
emotional, while the form is unmetrical, is or is not entitled to
be called a poem.&nbsp; That there may be a kind of unmetrical
narrative so poetic in motive, so concrete in diction, so
emotional in treatment, as to escape altogether from those
critical canons usually applied to prose, we shall see when, in
discussing the epic, we come to touch upon the Northern
sagas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the first critic who tacitly revolted against
the dictum that substance, and not form, is the indispensable
basis of poetry was Dionysius of Halicarnassus, whose treatise
upon the arrangement of words is really a very fine piece of
literary criticism.&nbsp; In his acute remarks upon the
arrangement of the words in the sixteenth book of the Odyssey, as
compared with that in the story of Gyges by Herodotus, was
perhaps first enunciated clearly the doctrine that poetry is
fundamentally a matter of style.&nbsp; The Aristotelian theory as
to invention, however, dominated all criticism after as well as
before Dionysius.&nbsp; When Bacon came to discuss the subject
(and afterwards), the only division between the poetical <a
name="page342"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 342</span>critics was
perhaps between the followers of Aristotle and those of Plato as
to what poetry should, and what it should not, imitate.&nbsp; It
is curious to speculate as to what would have been the result had
the poets followed the critics in this matter.&nbsp; Perhaps
there are critics of a very high rank who would class as poems
romances so concrete in method and diction, and so full of poetic
energy, as &lsquo;Wuthering Heights&rsquo; and &lsquo;Jane
Eyre,&rsquo; where we get absolutely all that Aristotle requires
for a poem.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, if this be so in regard to those great romances, it must
be still more so with regard to &lsquo;Aylwin,&rsquo; where
beauty and nothing but beauty seems to be the be-all and the
end-all of the work.</p>

</a></p>
<p>As &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; was begun in metre, it would be very
interesting to know on what lines the metre was
constructed.&nbsp; Readers of &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; have been
struck with the music of the opening sentences, which are given
as an extract from Philip Aylwin&rsquo;s book, &lsquo;The Veiled
Queen&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Those who in childhood have had solitary
communings with the sea know the sea&rsquo;s prophecy.&nbsp; They
know that there is a deeper sympathy between the sea and the soul
of man than other people dream of.&nbsp; They know that the water
seems nearer akin than the land to the spiritual world, inasmuch
as it is one and indivisible, and has motion, and answers to the
mysterious call of the winds, and is the writing tablet of the
moon and stars.&nbsp; When a child who, born beside the sea, and
beloved by the sea, feels suddenly, as he gazes upon it, a dim
sense of pity and warning; when there comes, or seems to come, a
shadow across the waves, with never a cloud in the sky to cast
it; when there comes a shuddering <a name="page343"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 343</span>as of wings that move in dread or
ire, then such a child feels as if the bloodhounds of calamity
are let loose upon him or upon those he loves; he feels that the
sea has told him all it dares tell or can.&nbsp; And, in other
moods of fate, when beneath a cloudy sky the myriad dimples of
the sea begin to sparkle as though the sun were shining bright
upon them, such a child feels, as he gazes at it, that the sea is
telling him of some great joy near at hand, or, at least, not far
off.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many a reader will echo the words of a writer in &lsquo;Notes
and Queries,&rsquo; who says that this passage has haunted him
since first he read it: I know it haunted me after I read
it.&nbsp; But I wonder how many critics have read this passage in
connection with Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s metrical studies which
have been carried on in the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; during
more than a quarter of a century.&nbsp; They are closely
connected with what he has said upon Bible rhythm in his article
upon the Psalms, which I have already quoted, and in many other
essays.&nbsp; Mr. Watts-Dunton, acknowledged to be a great
authority on metrical subjects, has for years been declaring that
we are on the verge of a new kind of metrical art
altogether&mdash;a metrical art in which the emotions govern the
metrical undulations.&nbsp; And I take the above passage and the
following to be examples of what the movement in
&lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; would have been if he had not abandoned the
project of writing the story in metre:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Then quoth the Ka&rsquo;dee, laughing until
his grinders appeared: &lsquo;Rather, by Allah, would I take all
the punishment thou dreadest, thou most false donkey-driver of
the Ruby Hills, than believe this story of thine&mdash;<a
name="page344"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 344</span>this mad,
mad story, that she with whom thou wast seen was not the living
wife of Hasan here (as these four legal witnesses have sworn),
but thine own dead spouse, Alawiyah, refashioned for thee by the
Angel of Memory out of thine own sorrow and unquenchable fountain
of tears.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Quoth Ja&rsquo;afar, bowing low his head: &lsquo;Bold is the
donkey-driver, O Ka&rsquo;dee! and bold the Ka&rsquo;dee who
dares say what he will believe, what disbelieve&mdash;not knowing
in any wise the mind of Allah&mdash;not knowing in any wise his
own heart and what it shall some day suffer.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Break these passages up into irregular lines, and you get a
new metre of a very emotional kind, governed as to length by the
sense pause.&nbsp; Mr. Watts-Dunton has been arguing for many
years that English verse is, as Coleridge long ago pointed out,
properly governed by the number of accents and not by the number
of syllables in a line, and that this accentual system is
governed, or should be governed, by emotion.&nbsp; It is a
singular thing, by the bye, that writer after writer of late has
been arguing over and over again Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s
arguments, and seems to be saying a new thing by using the word
&lsquo;stress&rsquo; for &lsquo;accent.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Stress&rsquo; may or may not be a better word than
&lsquo;accent,&rsquo; the word used by Coleridge, and after him
by Mr. Watts-Dunton, but the idea conveyed is one and the
same.&nbsp; I, for my part, believe that rare as new ideas may be
in creative work, they are still rarer in criticism.</p>

THE METHODS OF PROSE FICTION</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">And</span> now a word upon the imaginative
power of &lsquo;Aylwin.&rsquo;&nbsp; Very much has been written
both in England and on the Continent concerning the source of the
peculiar kind of &lsquo;imaginative vividness&rsquo; shown in the
story.&nbsp; The rushing narrative, as has been said, &lsquo;is
so fused in its molten stream that it seems one sentence, and it
carries the reader irresistibly along through pictures of beauty
and mystery till he becomes breathless.&rsquo;&nbsp; The truth
is, however, that the mere method of the evolution of the story
has a great deal more to do with this than is at first
apparent.&nbsp; Upon this artistic method very little has been
written save what I myself said when it first appeared.&nbsp; If
the unequalled grip of the story upon the reader had been secured
by methods as primitive, as unconscious as those of &lsquo;Jane
Eyre&rsquo; and &lsquo;Wuthering Heights,&rsquo; I should
estimate the pure, unadulterated imaginative force at work even
more highly than I now do.&nbsp; But, as a critic, I must always
inquire whether or not a writer&rsquo;s imaginative vision is
strengthened by constructive power.&nbsp; I must take into
account the aid that the imagination of the writer has received
from his mere self-conscious artistic skill.&nbsp; Now it is not
to praise &lsquo;Aylwin,&rsquo; but, I fear, to disparage it in a
certain sense to say that the power of the scenes owes much to
the mere artistic method, amounting at <a
name="page346"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 346</span>times to
subtlety.&nbsp; I have heard the greatest of living poets mention
&lsquo;Tom Jones,&rsquo; &lsquo;Waverley,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; as three great novels whose reception by the
outside public has been endorsed by criticism.&nbsp; One of the
signs of Scott&rsquo;s unique genius was the way in which he
invented and carried to perfection the method of moving towards
the d&eacute;nouement by dialogue as much as by narrative.&nbsp;
This gave a source of new brilliance to prose fiction, and it was
certainly one of the most effective causes of the enormous
success of &lsquo;Waverley.&rsquo;&nbsp; This masterpiece opens,
it will be remembered, in distinct imitation of the method of
Fielding, but soon broke into the new dramatic method with which
Scott&rsquo;s name is associated.&nbsp; But in
&lsquo;Waverley&rsquo; Scott had not yet begun to use the
dramatic method so freely as to sacrifice the very different
qualities imported into the novel by Fielding, whose method was
epic rather than dramatic.&nbsp; I think Mr. Watts-Dunton has
himself somewhere commented upon this, and said that Scott
carried the dramatic method quite as far as it could go without
making the story suffer from that kind of stageyness and
artificial brightness which is fatal to the novel.&nbsp;
Scott&rsquo;s disciple, Dumas, a more brilliant writer of
dialogue than Scott himself, but not so true a one, carried the
dramatic method too far and opened the way to mimics, who carried
it further still.&nbsp; In &lsquo;Aylwin,&rsquo; the blending of
the two methods, the epic and the dramatic, is so skilfully done
as to draw all the advantages that can be drawn from both; and
this skill must be an enormous aid to the imaginative
vision&mdash;an aid which Charlotte and Emily Bront&euml; had to
dispense with: but it is in the arrangement of the material on
self-conscious constructive principles that I am chiefly thinking
when I compare the imaginative vision in &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo;
with that in &lsquo;Jane Eyre&rsquo; and &lsquo;Wuthering
Heights.&rsquo;&nbsp; On the <a name="page347"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 347</span>whole, no one seems to have studied
&lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; from all points of view with so much insight
as Madame Galimberti, unless it be M. Jacottet in &lsquo;La
Semaine Litt&eacute;raire.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Watts-Dunton in one
of his essays has himself remarked that nine-tenths of the
interest of any dramatic situation are lost if before approaching
it the reader has not been made to feel an interest in the
characters, as Fielding makes us feel an interest in Tom and
Sophia long before they utter a word&mdash;indeed, long before
they are introduced at all.&nbsp; This is true, no doubt, and the
contemporary method of beginning a story like the opening of a
play with long dialogues between characters that are strangers to
the reader, is one among the many signs that, so far as securing
illusion goes, there is a real retrogression in fictive
art.&nbsp; A play, of course, must open in this way, but in an
acted play the characters come bodily before the audience as real
flesh and blood.&nbsp; They come surrounded by real
accessories.&nbsp; They win our sympathy or else our dislike as
soon as we see them and hear them speak.&nbsp; The dramatic
scenes between Jane Eyre and Rochester would miss half their
effect were it not for the picture of Jane as a child.&nbsp; In
&lsquo;Aylwin,&rsquo; by the time that there is any introduction
of dramatic dialogue the atmosphere of the story has enveloped
us: we have become so deeply in love with the two children that
the most commonplace words from their lips would have seemed
charged with beauty.&nbsp; This kind of perfection of the
novelist&rsquo;s art, in these days when stories are written to
pass through magazines and newspapers, seemed impossible till
&lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; appeared.&nbsp; It is curious to speculate
as to what would have been the success of the opening chapters of
&lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; if an instalment of the story had first made
its appearance in a magazine.</p>
<p>One of the most remarkable features of &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; is
<a name="page348"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 348</span>that in
spite of the strength and originality of the mere story and in
spite of the fact that the book is fundamentally the expression
of a creed, the character painting does not in the least suffer
from these facts.&nbsp; Striking and new as the story is, there
is nothing mechanical about the structure.&nbsp; The characters
are not, to use a well known phrase of the author&rsquo;s,
&lsquo;plot-ridden&rsquo; in the least degree, as are the
characters of the great masters of the plot-novel, Lytton,
Charles Reade, and Wilkie Collins, to mention only those who are
no longer with us.&nbsp; Perhaps in order to show what I mean I
ought to go a little into detail here.&nbsp; In &lsquo;Man and
Wife,&rsquo; for instance, Collins, with his eye only upon his
plot, makes the heroine, a lady whose delicacy of mind and
nobility of character are continually dwelt upon, not only by the
author but by a sagacious man of the world like Sir Peter, who
afterwards marries her, succumb to the animal advances of a brute
like Geoffrey.&nbsp; Many instances of the same sacrifice of
everything to plot occur in most of Collins&rsquo;s other
stories, and as to the &lsquo;long arm of coincidence&rsquo; he
not only avails himself of that arm whenever it is convenient to
do so, but he positively revels in his slavery to it.&nbsp; In
&lsquo;Armadale,&rsquo; for instance, besides scores of monstrous
improbabilities, such as the ship &lsquo;La Grace de Dieu&rsquo;
coming to Scotland expressly that Allan Armadale should board her
and have a dream upon her, and such as Midwinter&rsquo;s being by
accident brought into touch with Allan in a remote village in
Devonshire when he was upon the eve of death, we find
coincidences which are not of the smallest use, introduced simply
because the author loves coincidences&mdash;such as that of
making a family connection of Armadale&rsquo;s rescue Miss Gwilt
from drowning and get drowned himself, and thus bring about the
devolution of the property upon Allan <a name="page349"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 349</span>Armadale&mdash;an entirely
superfluous coincidence, for the working power of this incident
could have been secured in countless other ways.&nbsp; &lsquo;No
Name&rsquo; bristles with coincidences, such as that most
impudent one where the heroine is at the point of death by
destitution, and the one man who loves her and who had just
returned to England passes down the obscure and squalid street he
had never seen before at the very moment when she is
sinking.&nbsp; It is the same with Bulwer Lytton&rsquo;s
novels.&nbsp; In &lsquo;Night and Morning,&rsquo; for instance,
people are tossed against each other in London, the country, or
Paris at every moment whensoever the story demands it.&nbsp; As
to Gawtry, one of the few really original villains in modern
fiction, as soon as the story opens we expect him to turn up
every moment like a jack in-the-box; we expect him to meet the
hero in the most unlikely places, and to meet every other
character in the same way.&nbsp; Let his presence be required,
and we know that he will certainly turn up to put things
right.&nbsp; But in &lsquo;Aylwin,&rsquo; which has been well
called by a French critic, &lsquo;a novel without a
villain,&rsquo; where sinister circumstance takes the place of
the villain, there is not a single improbable coincidence;
everything flows from a few simple causes, such as the effect
upon an English patrician of love baffled by all kinds of
fantastic antagonisms, the influence of the doctrines of the dead
father upon the minds of several individuals, and the influence
of the impact of the characters upon each other.&nbsp; Another
thing to note is that in spite of the strange, new scenes in
which the characters move, they all display that &lsquo;softness
of touch&rsquo; upon which the author has himself written so
eloquently in one of his articles in the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um.&rsquo;&nbsp; I must find room to quote his
words on this interesting subject:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page350"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
350</span>&ldquo;The secret of the character-drawing of the great
masters seems to be this: while moulding the character from broad
general elements, from universal types of humanity, they are able
to delude the reader&rsquo;s imagination into mistaking the
picture for real portraiture, and this they achieve by making the
portrait seem to be drawn from particular and peculiar traits
instead of from generalities, and especially by hiding away all
purposes&mdash;&aelig;sthetic, ethic, or political.</p>
<p>One great virtue of the great masters is their winsome
softness of touch in character drawing.&nbsp; We are not fond of
comparing literary work with pictorial art, but between the work
of the novelist and the work of the portrait painter there does
seem a true analogy as regards the hardness and softness of touch
in the drawing of characters.&nbsp; In landscape painting that
hardness which the general public love is a fault; but in
portrait painting so important is it to avoid hardness that
unless the picture seems to have been blown upon the canvas, as
in the best work of Gainsborough, rather than to have been laid
upon it by the brush, the painter has not achieved a perfect
success.&nbsp; In the imaginative literature of England the two
great masters of this softness of touch in portraiture are
Addison and Sterne.&nbsp; Three or four hardly-drawn lines in Sir
Roger or the two Shandys, or Corporal Trim, would have ruined the
portraits so completely that they would never have come down to
us.&nbsp; Close upon Addison comes Scott, in whose vast gallery
almost every portrait is painted with a Gainsborough
softness.&nbsp; Scarcely one is limned with those hard lines
which are too often apt to mar the glorious work of
Dickens.&nbsp; After Scott comes Thackeray or Fielding, unless it
be Mrs. Gaskell.&nbsp; We are not in this article dealing with,
or even alluding to, contemporary writers, or we might easily say
what novelists follow Mrs. Gaskell.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page351"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 351</span>Read
in the light of these remarks the characters in
&lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; become still more interesting to the
critic.&nbsp; Observe how soft is the touch of the writer
compared with that of a novelist of real though eccentric genius,
Charles Reade.&nbsp; Now and again in Reade&rsquo;s portraits we
get softness, as in the painting of the delightful Mrs. Dodd and
her daughter, but it is very rare.&nbsp; The contrast between him
and Mr. Watts-Dunton in this regard is most conspicuously seen in
their treatment of members of what are called the upper
classes.&nbsp; No doubt Reade does occasionally catch (what
Charles Dickens never catches) that unconscious accent of high
breeding which Thackeray, with all his yearning to catch it,
scarcely ever could catch, save perhaps, in such a character as
Lord Kew, but which Disraeli catches perfectly in St.
Aldegonde.</p>
<p>On the appearance of &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; it was amusing to
see how puzzled many of the critics were when they came to talk
about the various classes in which the various figures
moved.&nbsp; How could a man give pictures of gypsies in their
tents, East Enders in their slums, Bohemian painters in their
studios, aristocrats in their country houses, and all of them
with equal vividness?&nbsp; But vividness is not always
truth.&nbsp; Some wondered whether the gypsies were true, when
&lsquo;up and spake&rsquo; the famous Tarno Rye himself, Groome,
the greatest authority on gypsies in the world, and said they
were true to the life.&nbsp; Following him, &lsquo;up and
spake&rsquo; Gypsy Smith, and proclaimed them to be &lsquo;the
only pictures of the gypsies that were true.&rsquo;&nbsp; Some
wondered whether the painters and Bohemians were rightly painted,
when &lsquo;up and spake&rsquo; Mr. Hake&mdash;more intimately
acquainted with them than any living man left save W. M. Rossetti
and Mr. Sharp&mdash;and said the pictures were as true as
photographs.&nbsp; But <a name="page352"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 352</span>before I pass on I must devote a few
parenthetical words to the most curious thing connected with this
matter.&nbsp; Not even the most captious critic, as far as I
remember, ventured to challenge the manners of the patricians who
play such an important part in the story.&nbsp; The Aylwin
family, as Madame Galimberti has hinted, belonged to the only
patriciate which either Landor or Disraeli recognized: the old
landed untitled gentry.&nbsp; The best delineator of this class
is, of course, Whyte Melville.&nbsp; But those who have read Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s remarks upon Byron in Chambers&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Cyclop&aelig;dia of English Literature&rsquo; will
understand how thoroughly he too has studied this most
interesting class.&nbsp; The hero himself, in spite of all his
eccentricity and in spite of all his Bohemianism, is a
patrician&mdash;a patrician to the very marrow.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There is not throughout Aylwin&rsquo;s narrative&mdash;a
narrative running to something under 200,000 words&mdash;a single
wrong note.&rsquo;&nbsp; This opinion I heard expressed by a very
eminent writer, who from his own birth and environment can speak
with authority.&nbsp; The way in which Henry Aylwin as a child is
made to feel that his hob-a-nobbing on equal terms with the
ragamuffin of the sands cannot really degrade an English
gentleman; the way in which Henry Aylwin, the hobbledehoy, is
made to feel that he cannot be lowered by living with gypsies, or
by marrying the daughter of &lsquo;the drunken organist who
violated my father&rsquo;s tomb&rsquo;; the way in which he says
that &lsquo;if society rejects him and his wife, he shall reject
society&rsquo;;&mdash;all this shows a mastery over
&lsquo;softness of touch&rsquo; in depicting this kind of
character such as not even Whyte Melville has equalled.&nbsp;
Henry Aylwin&rsquo;s mother, to whom the word trade and
plebeianism were synonymous terms, is the very type of the grande
dame, untouched by the vulgarities of the smart set of her <a
name="page353"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 353</span>time (for
there were vulgar smart sets then as there were vulgar smart sets
in the time of Beau Brummell, and as there are vulgar smart sets
now).&nbsp; Then there is that wonderful aunt, of whom we see so
little but whose influence is so great and so mischievous.&nbsp;
What a type is she of the meaner and more withered branch of a
patrician tree!&nbsp; But the picture of Lord Sleaford is by far
the most vivid portrait of a nobleman that has appeared in any
novel since &lsquo;Lothair.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thackeray never
&lsquo;knocked off&rsquo; a nobleman so airily and so
unconsciously as this delightful lordling, whose portrait Mr.
Watts-Dunton has &lsquo;blown&rsquo; upon his canvas in the true
Gainsborough way.&nbsp; I wish I could have got permission to
give more than a bird&rsquo;s-eye glance at Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s wide experience of all kinds of life, but I
can only touch upon what the reading public is already familiar
with.&nbsp; At one period of his life&mdash;the period during
which he and Whistler were brought together&mdash;the period when
&lsquo;Piccadilly,&rsquo; upon which they were both engaged, was
having its brief run, Mr. Watts-Dunton mixed very largely with
what was then, as now, humourously called
&lsquo;Society.&rsquo;&nbsp; It has been said that &lsquo;for a
few years not even &ldquo;Dicky Doyle&rdquo; or Jimmy Whistler
went about quite so much as Theodore Watts.&rsquo;&nbsp; I have
seen Whistler&rsquo;s presentation copy of the first edition of
&lsquo;The Gentle Art of Making Enemies&rsquo; with this
inscription:&mdash;&lsquo;To Theodore Watts, the
Worldling.&rsquo;&nbsp; Below this polite flash of persiflage the
famous butterfly flaunts its elusive wings.&nbsp; But this was
only Whistler&rsquo;s fun.&nbsp; Mr. Watts-Dunton was never, we
may be sure, a worldling.&nbsp; Still one wonders that the most
romantic of poets ever fell so low as to go into
&lsquo;Society&rsquo; with a big S.&nbsp; Perhaps it was because,
having studied life among the gypsies, life among the artists,
life among the literary men of the old Bohemia, life among <a
name="page354"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 354</span>the
professional and scientific classes, he thought he would study
the butterflies too.&nbsp; However, he seems soon to have got
satiated, for he suddenly dropped out of the smart
Paradise.&nbsp; I mention this episode because it alone, apart
from the power of his dramatic imagination, is sufficient to show
why in Henry Aylwin he has so successfully painted for us the
finest picture that has ever been painted of a true English
gentleman tossed about in scenes and among people of all sorts
and retaining the pristine bloom of England&rsquo;s patriciate
through it all.</p>
<p>In my essay upon Mr. Watts-Dunton in Chambers&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Cyclop&aelig;dia of English Literature,&rsquo; I made this
remark:&mdash;&ldquo;Notwithstanding the vogue of
&lsquo;Aylwin,&rsquo; there is no doubt that it is on his poems,
such as &lsquo;The Coming of Love,&rsquo; &lsquo;Christmas at the
Mermaid,&rsquo; &lsquo;Prophetic Pictures at Venice,&rsquo;
&lsquo;John the Pilgrim,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Omnipotence of
Love,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Three Fausts,&rsquo; &lsquo;What the
Silent Voices Said,&rsquo; &lsquo;Apollo in Paris,&rsquo;
&lsquo;The Wood-haunters&rsquo; Dream,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Octopus
of the Golden Isles,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Last Walk with Jowett from
Boar&rsquo;s Hill,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Omar Khayy&agrave;m,&rsquo;
that Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s future position will mainly
rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not say this rashly.&nbsp; But in order to justify my
opinion I must quote somewhat copiously from Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s remarks upon absolute and relative vision,
in the &lsquo;Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica.&rsquo;&nbsp; It has
been well said that &lsquo;in judging of the seeing power of any
work of imagination, either in prose or in verse, it is now
necessary always to try the work by the critical canons upon
absolute and relative vision laid down in this
treatise.&rsquo;&nbsp; If we turn to it, we shall find that
absolute vision is defined to be that vision which in its highest
dramatic exercise is unconditioned by the personal temperament of
the writer, while relative vision is defined to <a
name="page355"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 355</span>be that
vision which is more or less conditioned by the personal
temperament of the writer.&nbsp; And then follows a long
discussion of various great imaginative works in which the two
kinds of vision are seen:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For the achievement of most imaginative
work relative vision will suffice.&nbsp; If we consider the
matter thoroughly, in many forms&mdash;which at first sight might
seem to require absolute vision&mdash;we shall find nothing but
relative vision at work.&nbsp; Between relative and absolute
vision the difference is this, that the former only enables the
imaginative writer even in its very highest exercise, to make his
own individuality, or else humanity as represented by his own
individuality, live in the imagined situation; the latter enables
him in its highest exercise to make special individual characters
other than the poet&rsquo;s own live in the imagined
situation.&nbsp; In the very highest reaches of imaginative
writing art seems to become art no longer&mdash;it seems to
become the very voice of Nature herself.&nbsp; The cry of Priam
when he puts to his lips the hand that slew his son, is not
merely the cry of a bereaved and aged parent; it is the cry of
the individual king of Troy, and expresses above everything else
that most na&iuml;ve, pathetic, and winsome character.&nbsp; Put
the cry into the mouth of the irascible and passionate Lear, and
it would be entirely out of keeping.&nbsp; While the poet of
relative vision, even in its very highest exercise, can only,
when depicting the external world, deal with the general, the
poet of absolute vision can compete with Nature herself and deal
with both general and particular.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, the difference between &lsquo;The Coming of Love&rsquo;
and &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; is this, that in &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo;
the impulse is, <a name="page356"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
356</span>or seems to be, lyrical, and therefore too egoistic for
absolute vision to be achieved.&nbsp; Of course, if we are to
take Henry Aylwin in the novel to be an entirely dramatic
character, then that character is so full of vitality that it is
one of the most remarkable instances of purely dramatic
imagination that we have had in modern times.&nbsp; For there is
nothing that he says or does that is not inevitable from the
nature of the character placed in the dramatic situation.&nbsp;
Those who are as familiar as I am with Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s
prose writings outside &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; find it extremely
difficult to identify the brilliant critic of the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um,&rsquo; full of ripe wisdom and sagacity,
with the impassioned boy of the story.&nbsp; Indeed, I should
never have dreamed of identifying the character with the author
any more than I should have thought of identifying Philip Aylwin
with the author had it not been for the fact that Mr.
Watts-Dunton, in his preface to one of the constantly renewed
editions of his book, seems to suggest that identification
himself.&nbsp; I have already quoted the striking passage in the
introduction to the later editions of the book in which this
identification seems to be suggested.&nbsp; But, matters being as
they are with regard to the identification of the hero of the
prose story with the author, it is to &lsquo;The Coming of
Love&rsquo; that we must for the most part turn for proof that
the writer is possessed of absolute vision.&nbsp; Percy Aylwin
and Rhona are there presented in the purely dramatic way, and
they give utterance to their emotions, not only untrammelled by
the lyricism of the dramatist, but untrammelled also, as I have
before remarked, by the exigencies of a conscious dramatic
structure.&nbsp; In no poetry of our time can there be seen more
of that absolute vision so lucidly discoursed upon in the
foregoing extract.&nbsp; From her first love-letter <a
name="page357"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 357</span>Rhona leaps
into life, and she seems to be more elaborately painted not only
than any woman in recent poetry, but any woman in recent
literature.&nbsp; Percy Aylwin lives also with almost equal
vitality.&nbsp; I need not give examples of this here, for later
I shall quote freely from the poem in order that the reader may
form his own judgment, unbiassed by the views of myself or any
other critic.</p>
<p>With regard to &lsquo;Aylwin,&rsquo; however, apart from the
character of the hero, who is drawn lyrically or dramatically,
according, as I have said, to the evidence that he is or is not
the author himself, there are still many instances of a vision
that may be called absolute.&nbsp; Among the many letters from
strangers that reached the author when &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; first
appeared was one from a person who, like Henry Aylwin, had been
made lame by accident.&nbsp; This gentleman said that he felt
sure that the author of &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; had also been lame,
and gave several instances from the story which had made him come
to this conclusion.&nbsp; One was the following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Shall we go and get some
strawberries?&rsquo; she said, as we passed to the back of the
house.&nbsp; &lsquo;They are quite ripe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But my countenance fell at this.&nbsp; I was obliged to tell
her that I could not stoop.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! but I can, and I will pluck them and give them to
you.&nbsp; I should like to do it.&nbsp; Do let me, there&rsquo;s
a good boy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I consented, and hobbled by her side to the verge of the
strawberry-beds.&nbsp; But when I foolishly tried to follow her,
I stuck ignominiously, with my crutches sunk deep in the soft
mould of rotten leaves.&nbsp; Here was a trial for the conquering
hero of the coast.&nbsp; I <a name="page358"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 358</span>looked into her face to see if there
was not, at last, a laugh upon it.&nbsp; That cruel human laugh
was my only dread.&nbsp; To everything but ridicule I had
hardened myself; but against that I felt helpless.</p>
<p>I looked into her face to see if she was laughing at my
lameness.&nbsp; No: her brows were merely knit with anxiety as to
how she might best relieve me.&nbsp; This surpassingly beautiful
child, then, had evidently accepted me&mdash;lameness and
all&mdash;crutches and all&mdash;as a subject of peculiar
interest.</p>
<p>As I slowly approached the child, I could see by her forehead
(which in the sunshine gleamed like a globe of pearl), and
especially by her complexion, that she was uncommonly lovely, and
I was afraid lest she should look down before I got close to her,
and so see my crutches before her eyes encountered my
face.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a matter of fact, however, the author never had been
lame.</p>
<p>The following passages have often been quoted as instances of
the way in which a wonderful situation is realized as thoroughly
as if it had been of the most commonplace kind:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And what was the effect upon me of these
communings with the ancestors whose superstitions I have,
perhaps, been throughout this narrative treating in a spirit that
hardly becomes their descendant?</p>
<p>The best and briefest way of answering this question is to
confess not what I thought, as I went on studying my
father&rsquo;s book, its strange theories and revelations, but
what I did.&nbsp; I read the book all day long: I read it all the
next day.&nbsp; I cannot say what days passed.&nbsp; One night I
resumed my wanderings in the streets for <a
name="page359"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 359</span>an hour or
two, and then returned home and went to bed&mdash;but not to
sleep.&nbsp; For me there was no more sleep till those ancestral
voices could be quelled&mdash;till the sound of Winnie&rsquo;s
song in the street could be stopped in my ears.&nbsp; For very
relief from them I again leapt out of bed, lit a candle, unlocked
the cabinet, and, taking out the amulet, proceeded to examine the
facets as I did once before when I heard in the Swiss cottage
these words of my stricken father&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Should you ever come to love as I have loved, you will
find that materialism is intolerable&mdash;is hell
itself&mdash;to the heart that has known a passion like
mine.&nbsp; You will find that it is madness, Hal, madness, to
believe in the word &ldquo;never&rdquo;!&nbsp; You will find that
you dare not leave untried any creed, howsoever wild, that offers
the heart a ray of hope.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And then while the candle burnt out dead in the socket I sat
in a waking dream.</p>
<p>The bright light of morning was pouring through the
window.&nbsp; I gave a start of horror, and cried, &lsquo;Whose
face?&rsquo;&nbsp; Opposite to me there seemed to be sitting on a
bed the figure of a man with a fiery cross upon his breast.&nbsp;
That strange wild light upon the face, as if the pains at the
heart were flickering up through the flesh&mdash;where had I seen
it?&nbsp; For a moment when, in Switzerland, my father bared his
bosom to me, that ancestral flame had flashed up into his dull
lineaments.&nbsp; But upon the picture of &lsquo;The Sibyl&rsquo;
in the portrait-gallery that illumination was perpetual!</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is merely my own reflex in a looking-glass,&rsquo; I
exclaimed.</p>
<p>Without knowing it I had slung the cross round my neck.</p>
<p>And then Sinfi Lovell&rsquo;s voice seemed murmuring in <a
name="page360"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 360</span>my ears,
&lsquo;Fenella Stanley&rsquo;s dead and dust, and that&rsquo;s
why she can make you put that cross in your feyther&rsquo;s tomb,
and she will, she will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I turned the cross round: the front of it was now next to my
skin.&nbsp; Sharp as needles were those diamond and ruby points
as I sat and gazed in the glass.&nbsp; Slowly a sensation arose
on my breast, of pain that was a pleasure wild and new.&nbsp; I
was feeling the facets.&nbsp; But the tears trickling down, salt,
through my moustache were tears of laughter; for Sinfi Lovell
seemed again murmuring, &lsquo;For good or for ill, you must dig
deep to bury your daddy.&rsquo; . . .</p>
<p>What thoughts and what sensations were mine as I sat there,
pressing the sharp stones into my breast, thinking of her to whom
the sacred symbol had come, not as a blessing, but as a
curse&mdash;what agonies were mine as I sat there sobbing the one
word &lsquo;Winnie&rsquo;&mdash;could be understood by myself
alone, the latest blossom of the passionate blood that for
generations had brought bliss and bale to the Aylwins. . . .</p>
<p>I cannot tell what I felt and thought, but only what I
did.&nbsp; And while I did it my reason was all the time scoffing
at my heart (for whose imperious behoof the wild, mad things I am
about to record were done)&mdash;scoffing, as an Asiatic
malefactor will sometimes scoff at the executioner whose pitiless
and conquering saw is severing his bleeding body in twain.&nbsp;
I arose and murmured ironically to Fenella Stanley as I wrapped
the cross in a handkerchief and placed it in a hand-valise:
&lsquo;Secrecy is the first thing for us sacrilegists to
consider, dear Sibyl, in placing a valuable jewel in a tomb in a
deserted church.&nbsp; To take any one into our confidence would
be impossible; we must go alone.&nbsp; But to open the tomb and
close it again, and leave no trace of what <a
name="page361"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 361</span>has been
done, will require all our skill.&nbsp; And as burglars&rsquo;
jemmies are not on open sale we must buy, on our way to the
railway-station, screw-drivers, chisels, a hammer, and a lantern;
for who should know better than you, dear Sibyl, that the palace
of Nin-ki-gal is dark.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But after all I am unable to express any opinion worth
expressing upon the chief point which would decide the question
as to whether the imagination at work in &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; and
&lsquo;The Coming of Love&rsquo; is lyrical or dramatic, because
I do not know whether, like Henry Aylwin and Percy Aylwin, the
author has a dash of Romany blood in his veins.&nbsp; If he has
not that dash, and I certainly never heard that he has, and
neither Groome&rsquo;s words in the &lsquo;Bookman&rsquo; nor
&lsquo;Gypsy Smith&rsquo;s&rsquo; words can be construed into an
expression of opinion on the subject, then I will say with
confidence that his delineation of two English gentleman with an
ancestral Romany strain so like and yet so unlike as Henry Aylwin
and Percy Aylwin could only have been achieved by a wonderful
exercise of absolute vision.&nbsp; It was this that struck the
late Grant Allen so forcibly.&nbsp; On the other hand, if he has
that strain, then, as I have said before, it is not in the story
but in the poem that we must look for the best dramatic character
drawing.&nbsp; On this most interesting subject no one can speak
but himself, and he has not spoken.&nbsp; But here is what he has
said upon the similarity and the contrast between Percy and Henry
Aylwin:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Certain parts of &lsquo;The Coming of
Love&rsquo; were written about the same time as
&lsquo;Aylwin.&rsquo;&nbsp; The two Aylwins, Henry and Percy,
were then very distinct in my own mind; they are very distinct
now.&nbsp; And I confess that the possibility of their being
confounded with each other <a name="page362"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 362</span>had never occurred to me.&nbsp; A
certain similarity between the two there must needs be, seeing
that the blood of the same Romany ancestress, Fenella Stanley,
flows in the veins of both.&nbsp; I say there must needs be this
similarity, because the ancestress was Romany.&nbsp; For, without
starting the inquiry here as to whether or not the Romanies as a
race are superior or inferior to all or any of the great European
races among which they move, I will venture to affirm that in the
Romanies the mysterious energy which the evolutionists call
&lsquo;the prepotency of transmission&rsquo; in races is
specially strong&mdash;so strong, indeed, that evidences of
Romany blood in a family may be traced down for several
generations.&nbsp; It is inevitable, therefore, that in each of
the descendants of Fenella Stanley the form taken by the
love-passion should show itself in kindred ways.&nbsp; But the
reader who will give a careful study to the characters of Henry
and Percy Aylwin will come to the conclusion, I think, that the
similarity between the two is observable in one aspect of their
characters only.&nbsp; The intensity of the love-passion in each
assumes a spiritualizing and mystical form.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="page363"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
363</span>Chapter XXII<br />
A STORY WITH TWO HEROINES</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">One</span> thing seems clear to me: having
fully intended to make Winifred the heroine of
&lsquo;Alwyn&rsquo; round whom the main current of interest
should revolve, the author failed to do so.&nbsp; And the reason
of his failure is that Winifred has to succumb to the superior
vitality of Sinfi&rsquo;s commanding figure.&nbsp; For the
purpose of telling the story of Winifred and bringing out her
character he conceived and introduced this splendid descendant of
Fenella Stanley, and then found her, against his will, growing
under his hand until, at last, she pushed his own beloved heroine
off her pedestal, and stood herself for all time.&nbsp; Never did
author love his heroine as Mr. Watts-Dunton loves Winifred, and
there is nothing so curious in all fiction as the way in which he
seems at times to resent Sinfi&rsquo;s dominance over the Welsh
heroine; and this explains what readers have sometimes said about
his &lsquo;unkindness to Sinfi.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is quite certain that on the whole Sinfi is the
reader&rsquo;s heroine.&nbsp; When Madox Brown read the story in
manuscript, he became greatly enamoured of Sinfi, and talked
about her constantly.&nbsp; It was the same with Mr. Swinburne,
who says that &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; is the only novel he ever read
in manuscript, and found it as absorbing as if he were reading it
in type.&nbsp; Mr. George Meredith in a letter
said:&mdash;&ldquo;I am in love with Sinfi.&nbsp; Nowhere can
fiction <a name="page364"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
364</span>give us one to match her, not even the
&lsquo;Kriegspiel&rsquo; heroine, who touched me to the
deeps.&nbsp; Winifred&rsquo;s infancy has infancy&rsquo;s
charm.&nbsp; The young woman is taking.&nbsp; But all my heart
has gone to Sinfi.&nbsp; Of course it is part of her character
that her destiny should point to the glooms.&nbsp; The sun comes
to me again in her conquering presence.&nbsp; I could talk of her
for hours.&nbsp; The book has this defect,&mdash;it leaves in the
mind a cry for a successor.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the author of
&lsquo;Kriegspiel&rsquo; himself, F. H. Groome, accepts Sinfi as
the true heroine of the story.&nbsp; &ldquo;In Sinfi
Lovell,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;Mr. Watts-Dunton. would have
scored a magnificent success had he achieved nothing more than
this most splendid figure&mdash;supremely clever but utterly
illiterate, eloquent but ungrammatical, heroic but altogether
womanly.&nbsp; Winifred is good, and so too is Henry Aylwin
himself, and so are many of the minor characters (the mother, for
instance, the aunt, and Mrs. Gudgeon), but it is as the tragedy
of Sinfi&rsquo;s sacrifice that &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; should take
its place in literature.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes, it seems cruel to tell
the author this, but Sinfi, and not Winifred, with all her charm,
is evidently the favourite of his English public.&nbsp; That
admirable novelist, Mr. Richard Whiteing, said in the
&lsquo;Daily News&rsquo; that &lsquo;Sinfi Lovell is one of the
most finished studies of its type and kind in all romantic
literature.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

src="images/p364s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>I have somewhere seen Sinfi compared with Isopel
Berners.&nbsp; In the first place, while Sinfi is the crowning
type of the Romany chi, Isopel is, as the author has pointed out,
the type of the &lsquo;Anglo-Saxon road girl&rsquo; with a
special antagonism to Romany girls.&nbsp; Grand as is the
character of Borrow&rsquo;s Isopel Berners, she is not in the
least like Sinfi Lovell.&nbsp; And I may add that she is not
really like any other of the heroic women who figure in Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s gallery of noble women.&nbsp; <a
name="page365"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 365</span>It is,
however, interesting here to note that Mr. Watts-Dunton has a
special sympathy with women of this heroic type and a special
strength of hand in delineating them.&nbsp; There is nothing in
them of Isopel&rsquo;s hysterical tears.&nbsp; Once only does
Sinfi, in the nobility of her affection for Aylwin, yield to
weakness.&nbsp; Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s sympathy with this kind
of woman is apparent in his eulogy of
&lsquo;Shirley&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Note that it is not enough for the ideal
English girl to be beautiful and healthy, brilliant and
cultivated, generous and loving: she must be brave, there must be
in her a strain of Valkyrie; she must be of the high blood of
Brynhild, who would have taken Odin himself by the throat for the
man she loved.&nbsp; That is to say, that, having all the various
charms of English women, the ideal English girl must top them all
with that quality which is specially the English man&rsquo;s,
just as the English hero, the Nelson, the Sydney, having all the
various glories of other heroes, must top them all with that
quality which is specially the English
woman&rsquo;s&mdash;tenderness.&nbsp; What we mean is, that there
is a symmetry and a harmony in these matters; that just as it was
an English sailor who said, &lsquo;Kiss me, Hardy,&rsquo; when
dying on board the &lsquo;Victory&rsquo;&mdash;just as it was an
English gentleman who on the burning &lsquo;Amazon,&rsquo; stood
up one windy night, naked and blistered, to make of himself a
living screen between the flames and his young wife; so it was an
Englishwoman who threw her arms round that fire-screen, and
plunged into the sea; and an Englishwoman who, when bitten by a
dog, burnt out the bite from her beautiful arm with a red-hot
poker, and gave special instructions how she was to be smothered
when hydrophobia should set in.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page366"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 366</span>But
Mr. Watts-Dunton himself, in his sonnet, &lsquo;Brynhild on
Sigurd&rsquo;s Funeral Pyre,&rsquo; so powerfully illustrated by
Mr. Byam Shaw, has given us in fourteen lines a picture of
feminine courage and stoicism that puts even Charlotte
Bront&euml;&rsquo;s picture of Shirley in the shade:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>With blue eyes fixed on joy and sorrow past,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tall Brynhild stands on Sigurd&rsquo;s funeral
pyre;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She stoops to kiss his mouth, though forks of
fire<br />
Rise fighting with the reek and wintry blast;<br />
She smiles, though earth and sky are overcast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With shadow of wings that shudder of Asgard&rsquo;s
ire;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She weeps, but not because the gods conspire<br />
To quell her soul and break her heart at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Odin,&rdquo; she cries, &ldquo;it is for gods to
droop!&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Heroes! we still have man&rsquo;s all-sheltering
tomb,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where cometh peace at last, whate&rsquo;er may
come:<br />
Fate falters, yea, the very Norns shall stoop<br />
Before man&rsquo;s courage, naked, bare of hope,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing against all Hell and Death and Doom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rhona Boswell, too, under all her playful humour, is of this
strain, as we see in that sonnet on &lsquo;Kissing the
Maybuds&rsquo; in &lsquo;The Coming of Love&rsquo; (given on page
<span class="indexpageno"><a href="#page406">406</a></span> of
this book).</p>
<p>As Groome&rsquo;s remarks upon &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; are in
many ways of special interest, I will for a moment digress from
the main current of my argument, and say a few words about
it.&nbsp; Of course as the gypsies figure so largely in this
story, there were very few writers competent to review it from
the Romany point of view.&nbsp; Leland was living when it
appeared, but he was residing on the Continent; moreover, at his
age, and engrossed as he was, it was not likely that he would
undertake to review it.&nbsp; There was another Romany scholar,
spoken of with enthusiasm by Groome&mdash;I allude to <a
name="page367"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 367</span>Mr.
Sampson, of Liverpool, who has since edited Borrow&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Romany Rye&rsquo; for Messrs. Methuen, and who is said to
know more of Welsh Romany than any Englishman ever knew
before.&nbsp; At that time, however, he was almost unknown.&nbsp;
Finally, there was Groome himself, whose articles in the
&lsquo;Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Chambers&rsquo;s Encyclop&aelig;dia,&rsquo; had proclaimed
him to be the greatest living gypsologist.&nbsp; The editor of
the &lsquo;Bookman,&rsquo; being anxious to get a review of the
book from the most competent writer he could find, secured Groome
himself.&nbsp; I can give only a few sentences from the
review.&nbsp; Groome, it will be seen, does not miss the
opportunity of flicking in his usual satirical manner the
omniscience of some popular novelists:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Novelty and truth,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;are &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo;s&rsquo; chief characteristics, a
rare combination nowadays.&nbsp; Our older novelists&mdash;those
at least still held in remembrance&mdash;wrote only of what they
knew, or of what they had painfully mastered.&nbsp; Defoe,
Richardson, Fielding, Smollett, Sterne, Jane Austen, Scott,
Dickens, Thackeray, the Bront&euml;s, and George Eliot belong to
the foremost rank of these; for types of the second or the third
may stand Marryat, Lever, Charles Reade, James Grant, Surtees,
Whyte Melville, and Wilkie Collins.&nbsp; But now we have changed
all that; the maximum of achievement seldom rises above school
board nescience.&nbsp; With a few exceptions (one could count
them on the ten fingers) our present-day novelists seem to write
only about things of which they clearly know nothing.&nbsp; One
of the most popular lays the scene of a story in Paris: the Seine
there is tidal, it rolls a murdered corpse upwards.&nbsp; In
another work by her a gambler shoots himself in a cab.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I trust,&rsquo; cries a friend who has heard the shot,
&lsquo;he has missed.&rsquo;&nbsp; <a name="page368"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 368</span>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; says a second
friend, &lsquo;he was a dead shot.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. X. writes a
realistic novel about betting.&nbsp; It is crammed with weights,
acceptances, and all the rest of it; but, alas! on an early page
a servant girl wins 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> at 7 to 1.&nbsp; Mrs.
Y. takes her heroine to a Scottish deer-forest: it is full of
primeval oaks.&nbsp; Mrs. Z. sends her hero out
deerstalking.&nbsp; Following a hill-range, he sights a stag upon
the opposite height, fires at it, and kills his benefactor, who
is strolling below in the glen.&nbsp; And Mr. Ampersand in his
masterpiece shows up the littleness of the Establishment: his
ritualistic church presents the inconceivable conjunction of the
Ten Commandments and a gorgeous rood-screen.&nbsp; I have drawn
upon memory for these six examples, but subscribers to
Mudie&rsquo;s should readily recognize the books I mean; they
have sold by thousands on thousands.&nbsp; &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo;
is not such as these.&nbsp; There is much in it of the country,
of open-air life, of mountain scenery, of artistic fellowship, of
Gypsydom; it might be called the novel of the two
Bohemias.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many readers have expressed the desire to know something about
the prototypes of Sinfi Lovell and Rhona Boswell.&nbsp; The
following words from the Introduction to the 20th edition (called
the &lsquo;Snowdon Edition&rsquo;) may therefore be read with
interest:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Although Borrow belonged to a different
generation from mine, I enjoyed his intimate friendship in his
later years&mdash;during the time when he lived in Hereford
Square.&nbsp; When, some seven or eight years ago, I brought out
an edition of &lsquo;Lavengro,&rsquo; I prefaced that delightful
book by a few desultory remarks upon Borrow&rsquo;s gypsy
characters.&nbsp; On that occasion I gave a slight sketch of the
most remarkable &lsquo;Romany Chi&rsquo; that had ever been met
with in the part of East Anglia known to Borrow and
myself&mdash;Sinfi <a name="page369"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
369</span>Lovell.&nbsp; I described her playing on the
crwth.&nbsp; I discussed her exploits as a boxer, and I
contrasted her in many ways with the glorious Anglo-Saxon
road-girl Isopel Berners.</p>
<p>Since the publication of &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; and &lsquo;The
Coming of Love&rsquo; I have received very many letters from
English and American readers inquiring whether &lsquo;the Gypsy
girl described in the introduction to &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; is
the same as the Sinfi Lovell of &ldquo;Aylwin,&rdquo; and also
whether &lsquo;the Rhona Boswell that figures in the prose story
is the same as the Rhona of &ldquo;The Coming of
Love?&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; The evidence of the reality of Rhona so
impressed itself upon the reader that on the appearance of
Rhona&rsquo;s first letter in the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um,&rsquo;
where the poem was printed in fragments, I got among other
letters one from the sweet poet and adorable woman Jean Ingelow,
who was then very ill,&mdash;near her death indeed,&mdash;urging
me to tell her whether Rhona&rsquo;s love-letter was not a
versification of a real letter from a real gypsy to her
lover.&nbsp; As it was obviously impossible for me to answer the
queries individually, I take this opportunity of saying that the
Sinfi of &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; and the Sinfi described in my
introduction to &lsquo;Lavengro&rsquo; are one and the same
character&mdash;except that the story of the child Sinfi&rsquo;s
weeping for the &lsquo;poor dead Gorgios&rsquo; in the
churchyard, given in the Introduction, is really told by the
gypsies, not of Sinfi, but of Rhona Boswell.&nbsp; Sinfi is the
character alluded to in the now famous sonnet describing
&lsquo;the walking lord of gypsy lore,&rsquo; Borrow; by his most
intimate friend, Dr. Gordon Hake.</p>
<p>Now that so many of the gryengroes (horse-dealers), who form
the aristocracy of the Romany race, have left England for
America, it is natural enough that to some readers of
&lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Coming of Love,&rsquo; my <a
name="page370"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 370</span>pictures of
Romany life seem a little idealized.&nbsp; The
&lsquo;Times,&rsquo; in a kindly notice of &lsquo;The Coming of
Love,&rsquo; said that the kind of gypsies there depicted are a
very interesting people, &lsquo;unless the author has flattered
them unduly.&rsquo;&nbsp; Those who best knew the gypsy women of
that period will be the first to aver that I have not flattered
them unduly.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is Winifred who shares, not only with Henry Aylwin, but
also with the author himself, that love of the wind which he
revealed in the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; many years before
&lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; was published.&nbsp; I may quote this
passage in praise of the wind as an example of the way in which
his imaginative work and his critical work are often
interwoven:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There is no surer test of genuine nature
instinct than this.&nbsp; Anybody can love sunshine.&nbsp; No
people had less of the nature instinct than the Romans, but they
could enjoy the sun; they even took their solaria or sun-baths,
and gave them to their children.&nbsp; And, if it may be said
that no Roman loved the wind, how much more may this be said of
the French!&nbsp; None but a born child of the tent could ever
have written about the winds of heaven as Victor Hugo has written
in &lsquo;Les Travailleurs de la Mer,&rsquo; as though they were
the ministers of Ahriman.&nbsp; &lsquo;From Ormuzd, not from
Ahriman, ye come.&rsquo;&nbsp; And here, indeed, is the
difference between the two nationalities.&nbsp; Love of the wind
has made England what she is; dread of the wind has greatly
contributed to make France what she is.&nbsp; The winds are the
breathings of the Great Mother.&nbsp; Under the &lsquo;olden
spell&rsquo; of dumbness, nature can yet speak to us by her
winds.&nbsp; It is they that express her every mood, and, if her
mood is rough at times, her <a name="page371"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 371</span>heart is kind.&nbsp; This is why the
true child of the open-air&mdash;never mind how much he may
suffer from the wind&mdash;loves it, loves it as much when it
comes and &lsquo;takes the ruffian billows by the top&rsquo; to
the peril of his life, as when it comes from the sweet
South.&nbsp; In the wind&rsquo;s most boisterous moods, such as
those so splendidly depicted by Dana in the doubling of Cape
Horn, there is an exhilaration, a fierce delight, in struggling
with it.&nbsp; It is delightful to read Thoreau when he writes
about the wind, and that which the wind so loves&mdash;the
snow.&rdquo;</p>

THE RENASCENCE OF WONDER IN RELIGION</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">And</span> now as to the real inner
meaning of &lsquo;Alwyin,&rsquo; about which so much has been
written.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;Aylwin,&rsquo;&rdquo; says Groome,
&ldquo;is a passionate love-story, with a mystical id&eacute;e
m&egrave;re.&nbsp; For the entire dramatic action revolves around
a thought that is coming more and more to the front&mdash;the
difference, namely, between a materialistic and a spiritualistic
cosmogony.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Dr. Nicoll, in his essay on
&ldquo;The Significance of &lsquo;Aylwin,&rsquo;&rdquo; in the
&lsquo;Contemporary Review,&rsquo; says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Every serious student will see at a glance
that &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; is a concrete expression of the
author&rsquo;s criticism of life and literature, and
even&mdash;though this must be said with more reserve&mdash;a
concrete expression of his theory of the universe.&nbsp; This
theory I will venture to define as an optimistic confronting of
the new cosmogony of growth on which the author has for long
descanted.&nbsp; Throughout all his writings there is evidence of
a mental struggle as severe as George Eliot&rsquo;s with that
materialistic reading of the universe which seemed forced upon
thinkers when the doctrine of evolution passed from hypothesis to
an accepted theory.&nbsp; Those who have followed Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s writings in the &lsquo;Examiner&rsquo; and
in the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; must have observed with what
passionate eagerness he insisted <a name="page373"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 373</span>that Darwinism, if properly
understood, would carry us no nearer to materialism than did the
spiritualistic cosmogonies of old, unless it could establish
abiogenesis against biogenesis.&nbsp; As every experiment of
every biologist has failed to do so, a new spiritualist cosmogony
must be taught.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And yet the student of &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; must bear in mind
that some critics, taking the very opposite view, have said that
its final teaching is not meant to be mystical at all, but
anti-mystical&mdash;that what to Philip Aylwin and his disciples
seems so mystical is all explained by the operation of natural
laws.&nbsp; This theory reminds me of a saying of Goethe&rsquo;s
about the enigmatic nature of all true and great works of
art.&nbsp; I forget the exact words, but they set me thinking
about the chameleon-like iridescence of great poems and
dramas.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>With regard to the fountain-head of all the mysticism of the
story, Philip Aylwin, much has been said.&nbsp; Philip is the
real protagonist of the story&mdash;he governs, as I have said,
the entire dramatic action from his grave, and illustrates at
every point Sinfi Lovell&rsquo;s saying, &lsquo;You must dig deep
to bury your daddy.&rsquo;&nbsp; Everything that occurs seems to
be the result of the father&rsquo;s speculations, and the effect
of them upon other minds like that of his son and that of
Wilderspin.</p>
<p>The appearance of this new epic of spiritual love came at
exactly the right moment&mdash;came when a new century was about
to dawn which will throw off the trammels of old modes of
thought.&nbsp; While I am writing these lines Mr. Balfour at the
British Association has been expounding what must be called
&lsquo;Aylwinism,&rsquo; and (as I shall show in the last chapter
of this book) <a name="page374"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
374</span>saying in other words what Henry Aylwin&rsquo;s father
said in &lsquo;The Veiled Queen.&rsquo;&nbsp; In the preface to
the edition of &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; in the &lsquo;World&rsquo;s
Classics&rsquo; the author says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The heart-thought of this book being the
peculiar doctrine in Philip Aylwin&rsquo;s &lsquo;Veiled
Queen,&rsquo; and the effect of it upon the fortunes of the hero
and the other characters, the name &lsquo;The Renascence of
Wonder&rsquo; was the first that came to my mind when confronting
the difficult question of finding a name for a book that is at
once a love-story and an expression of a creed.&nbsp; But
eventually I decided, and I think from the worldly point of view
wisely, to give it simply the name of the hero.</p>
<p>The important place in the story, however, taken by this
creed, did not escape the most acute and painstaking of the
critics.&nbsp; Madame Galimberti, for instance, in the elaborate
study of the book which she made in the &lsquo;Rivista
d&rsquo;Italia,&rsquo; gave great attention to its central idea;
so did M. Maurice Muret, in the &lsquo;Journal des
D&eacute;bats&rsquo;; so did M. Henri Jacottet in &lsquo;La
Semaine Litt&eacute;raire.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Baker, again, in his
recently published &lsquo;Guide to Fiction,&rsquo; described
&lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; as &ldquo;an imaginative romance of modern
days, the moral idea of which is man&rsquo;s attitude in face of
the unknown, or, as the writer puts it, &lsquo;the renascence of
wonder.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; With regard to the phrase itself, in
the introduction to the latest edition of
&lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo;&mdash;the twenty-second edition&mdash;I made
the following brief reply to certain questions that have been
raised by critics both in England and on the Continent concerning
it.&nbsp; The phrase, I said, &lsquo;The Renascence of
Wonder,&rsquo; &lsquo;is used to express that great revived
movement of the soul of man which is generally said to have begun
with the poetry of Wordsworth, Scott, Coleridge, and others, and
after many varieties of <a name="page375"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 375</span>expression reached its culmination
in the poems and pictures of Rossetti.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The painter Wilderspin says to Henry Aylwin, &lsquo;The one
great event of my life has been the reading of &ldquo;The Veiled
Queen,&rdquo; your father&rsquo;s book of inspired wisdom upon
the modern Renascence of Wonder in the mind of man.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And further on he says that his own great picture symbolical of
this renascence was suggested by Philip Aylwin&rsquo;s
vignette.&nbsp; Since the original writing of
&lsquo;Aylwin,&rsquo; many years ago, I have enlarged upon its
central idea in the &lsquo;Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica,&rsquo;
in the introductory essay to the third volume of
&lsquo;Chambers&rsquo;s Cyclop&aelig;dia of English
Literature,&rsquo; and in other places.&nbsp; Naturally,
therefore, the phrase has been a good deal discussed.&nbsp; Quite
lately Dr. Robertson Nicoll has directed attention to the phrase,
and he has taken it as a text of a remarkable discourse upon the
&lsquo;Renascence of Wonder in Religion.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Watts-Dunton then quotes Dr. Nicoll&rsquo;s remarks upon
the Logia recently discovered by the explorers of the Egypt
Fund.&nbsp; He shows how men came to see &lsquo;once more the
marvel of the universe and the romance of man&rsquo;s
destiny.&nbsp; They became aware of the spiritual world, of the
supernatural, of the lifelong struggle of soul, of the power of
the unseen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The words quoted by Dr. Nicoll might very appropriately
be used as a motto for &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; and also for its
sequel &lsquo;The Coming of Love: Rhona Boswell&rsquo;s
Story.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>When &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; first appeared, the
editor of a well-known journal sent it to me for review.&nbsp; I
read it: never shall I forget that reading.&nbsp; I was in
Ireland at the time&mdash;an Irish Wedding Guest at an Irish
Wedding.&nbsp; Now <a name="page376"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
376</span>an Irish Wedding is more joyous than any novel, and
Irish girls are lovelier than any romance.&nbsp; A duel between
Life and Literature!&nbsp; Picture it!&nbsp; Behold the Irish
Wedding Guest spell-bound by a story-teller as cunning as
&lsquo;The Ancient Mariner&rsquo; himself!&nbsp; He heareth the
bridal music, but Aylwin continueth his tale: he cannot choose
but hear, until &lsquo;The Curse&rsquo; of the &lsquo;The
Moonlight Cross&rsquo; of the Gnostics is finally expiated, and
Aylwin and Winnie see in the soul of the sunset &lsquo;The
Dukkeripen of the Trush&ugrave;l,&rsquo; the blessed Cross of
Rose and Gold.&nbsp; Amid the &lsquo;merry din&rsquo; of the
Irish Wedding Feast the Irish Wedding Guest read and wrote.&nbsp;
And among other lyrical things, he said that &lsquo;since
Shakespeare created Ophelia there has been nothing in literature
so moving, so pathetic, so unimaginably sorrowful as the madness
of Winnie Wynne.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he also said that &ldquo;the
majority of readers will delight in &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; as the
most wonderful of love stories, but as the years go by an ever
increasing number will find in it the germ of a new religion, a
clarified spiritualism, free from charlatanry, a solace and a
consolation for the soul amid the bludgeonings of circumstance
and the cruelties of fate.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Watts-Dunton, when I told him that I was going to write
this book, urged me to moderate my praise and to call into action
the critical power that he was good enough to say that I
possessed.&nbsp; He especially asked me not to repeat the above
words, the warmth of which, he said, might be misconstrued; but
the courage of my opinions I will exercise so long as I write at
all.&nbsp; The &lsquo;newspaper cynics&rsquo; that once were and
perhaps still are strong, I have always defied and always will
defy.&nbsp; I am glad to see that there is one point of likeness
between us of the younger generation and the great one to which
Mr. Watts-Dunton and his illustrious friends belong.&nbsp; <a
name="page377"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 377</span>We are not
afraid and we are not ashamed of being enthusiastic.&nbsp; This,
also, I hope, will be a note of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>No doubt mine was a bold prophecy to utter in a rapid review
of a romance, but time has shown that it was not a rash
one.&nbsp; The truth is that the real vogue of
&lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; as a message to the soul is only
beginning.&nbsp; Five years have elapsed since the publication of
&lsquo;Aylwin,&rsquo; and during that time it has, I think,
passed into twenty-four editions in England alone, the latest of
all these editions being the beautiful &lsquo;Arvon
Edition,&rsquo; not to speak of the vast issue in sixpenny
form.</p>
<p>I will now quote the words of a very accomplished scholar and
critic upon the inner meaning of &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo;
generally.&nbsp; They appeared in the &lsquo;Saturday
Review&rsquo; of October 1904, and they show that the interest in
the book, so far from waning, is increasing:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Public taste has for once made a lucky
shot, and we are only too pleased to be able to put an item to
the credit of an account in taste, where the balance is so
heavily on the wrong side.&nbsp; How &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; ever
came to be a popular success is hard indeed to understand.&nbsp;
We cannot wonder at the doubts of a popular reception confessed
to by Mr. Watts-Dunton in his dedication of the latest edition to
Mr. Ernest Rhys.&nbsp; How did a book, notable for its poetry and
subtlety of thought, come to appeal to an English public?&nbsp;
That it should have a vogue in Wales was natural; Welsh
patriotism would assure a certain success, though by itself it
could not indeed have made the book the household word it has now
become throughout all Wales.&nbsp; And undoubtedly its Welsh
reception has been the more intelligent; it has been welcomed
there for the qualities that most deserved <a
name="page378"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 378</span>a welcome;
while in England we fear that in many quarters it has rather been
welcomed in spite of them.&nbsp; The average English man and
woman do not like mystery and distrust poetry.&nbsp; They have
little sympathy with the &lsquo;renascence of wonder,&rsquo;
which some new passages unfold to us in the Arvon edition,
passages originally omitted for fear of excessive length and now
restored from the MS.&nbsp; We are glad to have them, for they
illustrate further the intellectual motive of the book.&nbsp; We
are of those who do not care to take &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; merely
as a novel.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These words remind me of two reviews of &lsquo;Aylwin,&rsquo;
one by Mr. W. P. Ryan, a fellow-countryman of mine, which was
published when &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; first appeared, the other by
an eminent French writer.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The salient impression on the reader is
that he is looking full into deep reaches of life and
spirituality rather than temporary pursuits and mundane
ambitions.&nbsp; In this regard, in its freedom from littleness,
its breadth of life, its exaltation of mood, its sense of serene
issues that do not pass with the changing fashions of a
generation, the book is almost epic.</p>
<p>But &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; has yet other sides.&nbsp; It is a
vital and seizing story.&nbsp; The girl-heroine is a beautiful
presentment, and the struggle with destiny, when, believing in
the efficacy of a mystic&rsquo;s curse she loses her reason, and
flies from poignantly idyllic life to harrowing life, her
stricken lover in her wake, is nearly Greek in its intensity and
pathos.&nbsp; The long, long quest through the mountain magic of
Wales, the wandering spheres of Romany-land, and the art-reaches
of London, could only be made real and convincing by triumphant
art.&nbsp; A less expert pioneer <a name="page379"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 379</span>would enlarge his effects in details
that would dissipate their magic; Mr. Watts-Dunton knows that one
inspired touch is worth many uninspired chapters, as Shakespeare
knew that &lsquo;she should have died hereafter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Death came on her like an untimely frost,<br />
Upon the fairest flower of all the field.</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>Childe Rowland to the dark tower came,</p>
<p>is worth an afternoon of emphasis, a night of mystical
elaboration.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the Celtic and Romany types of character reveal
their essence.&nbsp; Here, too, the author preserves the artistic
unities.&nbsp; Delightful as one realizes these characters to be,
full-blooded personalities though they are, it is still their
spirit, and through it the larger spirit of their race, that
shines clearest.&nbsp; Their story is all realistic, and yet it
leaves the flavour of a fairy tale of Regeneration.&nbsp; At
first sight one is inclined to speak of their beautiful kinship
with Nature; but the truth is that Nature and they together are
seen with spiritual eyes; that they and Nature are different but
kindred embodiments of the underlying, all-extending, universal
soul; that Henry&rsquo;s love, and Winnie&rsquo;s rapture, and
Snowdon&rsquo;s magic, and Sinfi&rsquo;s crwth, and the little
song of y Wydffa, and the glorious mountain dawn are but drops
and notes in a melodic mystic ocean, of which the farthest stars
and the deepest loves are kindred and inevitable
parts&mdash;parts of a whole, of whose ministry we hardly know
the elements, yet are cognisant that our highest joy is to feel
in radiant moments that we, too, are part of the harmony.&nbsp;
In idyll, despair or tragedy, the beauty of &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo;
is that always the song of the divine in <a
name="page380"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 380</span>humanity is
beneath it.&nbsp; Everything merges into one consistent,
artistically suggested, spiritual conception of life; love tried,
tortured, finally rewarded as the supreme force utilized to drive
home the intolerable negation and atrophy of materialism; in
Henry&rsquo;s gnostic father, in the scientific Henry himself,
the Romany Sinfi, Winnie whose nature is a song, Wilderspin who
believes that his model is a heavenly visitant with an immaterial
body, D&rsquo;Arcy who stands for Rossetti, the end is the same;
and the striking trait is the felicity with which so many
dissimilar personalities, while playing the drama of divergent
actuality to the full, yet realize and illustrate, without
apparent manipulation by the author, the one abiding spiritual
unity.</p>
<p>In execution, &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; is far above the
accomplished English novel-work of latter years; as a conception
of life it surely transcends all.&nbsp; The &lsquo;schools&rsquo;
we have known: the realistic, the romantic, the quasi-historical,
the local, seem but parts of the whole when their motives are
measured with the idea that permeates this novel.&nbsp; They take
drear or gallant roads through limited lands; it rises like a
stately hill from which a world is clearer, above and beyond
whose limits there are visions, Voices, and the
verities.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With equal eloquence M. Jacottet on the same day wrote about
&ldquo;Aylwin&rdquo; in &lsquo;La Semaine
Litt&eacute;raire&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The central idea of this poetic book is
that of love stronger than death, love elevating the soul to a
mystical conception of the universe.&nbsp; It is a singular fact
that at the moment when England, intoxicated with her successes,
seems to have no room for thought except with regard to her fleet
and her commerce, and allows herself to be dazzled by dreams of
universal empire, the <a name="page381"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 381</span>book in vogue should be Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s romance&mdash;the most idealistic, the
farthest removed from the modern Anglo-Saxon conception of life
that he could possibly conceive.&nbsp; But this fact has often
been observable in literary history.&nbsp; Is not the true charm
of letters that of giving to the soul respite from the
brutalities of contemporary events?&rdquo;</p>

THE RENASCENCE OF WONDER IN HUMOUR</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> character of Mrs. Gudgeon in
&lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; stands as entirely alone among humourous
characters as does Sancho Panza, Falstaff, Mrs. Quickly or Mrs.
Partridge.&nbsp; In my own review of &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; I thus
noted the entirely new kind of humour which characterizes
it:&mdash;&ldquo;To one aspect of this book we have not yet
alluded, namely, its humour.&nbsp; Whimsical Mrs. Gudgeon, the
drunken virago who pretends that Winnie is her daughter, is
inimitable, with her quaint saying: &lsquo;I shall die
a-larfin&rsquo;, they say in Primrose Court, and so I
shall&mdash;unless I die a-crying.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Few
critics have done justice to Mrs. Gudgeon, although the
&lsquo;Times&rsquo; said: &lsquo;In Mrs. Gudgeon, one of his
characters, the author has accomplished the feat of creating what
seems to be a new comic figure,&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Saturday
Review&rsquo; singled her out as being the triumph of the
book&rdquo;.&nbsp; Could she really have been a real
character?&nbsp; Could there ever have existed in the London of
the mid-Victorian period a real flesh and blood costermonger so
rich in humour that her very name sheds a glow of laughter over
every page in which it appears?&nbsp; According to Mr. Hake, she
was suggested by a real woman, and this makes me almost lament my
arrival in London too late to make her acquaintance.&nbsp;
&ldquo;With regard to the most original character of the
story,&rdquo; says Mr. Hake, &ldquo;those who knew
Clement&rsquo;s Inn, where I myself once resided, and
Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields, will be able at once to identify Mrs.
<a name="page383"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 383</span>Gudgeon,
who lived in one of the streets running into Clare Market.&nbsp;
Her business was that of night coffee-stall keeper.&nbsp; At one
time, I believe&mdash;but I am not certain about this&mdash;she
kept a stall on the Surrey side of Waterloo Bridge, and it might
have been there that, as I have been told, her portrait was drawn
for a specified number of early breakfasts by an unfortunate
artist who sank very low, but had real ability.&nbsp; Her
constant phrase was &lsquo;I shall die
o&rsquo;-laughin&rsquo;&mdash;I know I shall!&rsquo;&nbsp; On
account of her extraordinary gift of repartee, and her
inexhaustible fund of wit and humour, she was generally supposed
to be an Irishwoman.&nbsp; But she was not; she was cockney to
the marrow.&nbsp; Recluse as Rossetti was in his later years, he
had at one time been very different, and could bring himself in
touch with the lower orders of London in a way such as was only
known to his most intimate friends.&nbsp; With all her impudence,
and I may say insolence, Mrs. Gudgeon was a great favourite with
the police, who were the constant butts of her chaff.&rdquo; <a
name="citation383"></a><a href="#footnote383"
class="citation">[383]</a>&nbsp; But, of course, this interesting
costermonger could have only suggested our unique Mrs.
Gudgeon.</p>
<p>She shows that it is possible to paint a low-class humourist
as rich in the new cosmic humour as any one of Dickens&rsquo;s is
rich in the old terrene humour, and yet without one Dickensian
touch.&nbsp; The difficulty of achieving this feat is manifested
every day, both in novels and on the stage.&nbsp; Until Mrs.
Gudgeon appeared I thought that Dickens had made it as impossible
for another writer to paint humourous pictures of low-class
London women as Swinburne has made it impossible for another poet
to write in anap&aelig;sts.&nbsp; But there is in all that Mrs.
Gudgeon says or does a profundity of humour so much deeper than
<a name="page384"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 384</span>the
humour of Mrs. Gamp, that it wins her a separate niche in our
gallery of humourous women.&nbsp; The chief cause of the delight
which Mrs. Gudgeon gives me is that she illustrates Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s theory of absolute humour as distinguished
from relative humour&mdash;a theory which delighted me in those
boyish days in Ireland, to which I have already alluded.&nbsp; I
have read his words on this theme so often that I think I could
repeat them as fluently as a nursery rhyme.&nbsp; In their
original form I remember that the word &lsquo;caricature&rsquo;
took the place of the phrase &lsquo;relative humour.&rsquo;&nbsp;
I do not think there is anything in Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s
writings so suggestive and so profound, and to find in reading
&lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; that they were suggested to him by a real
living character was exhilarating indeed.</p>
<p>Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s theory of humour is one of his most
original generalizations, and it is vitally related both to his
theory of poetry and to his generalization of generalizations,
&lsquo;The Renascence of Wonder.&rsquo;&nbsp; I think Mrs.
Gudgeon is a cockney Anacharsis in petticoats.&nbsp; The Scythian
philosopher, it will be remembered, when jesters were taken to
him, could not be made to smile, but afterwards, when a monkey
was brought to him, broke out into a fit of laughter and said,
&lsquo;Now this is laughable by nature, the other by
art.&rsquo;&nbsp; I will now quote the essay on absolute and
relative humour:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Anarcharsis, who found the humour of Nature
alone laughable, was the absolute humourist as distinguished from
the relative humourist, who only finds food for laughter in the
distortions of so-called humourous art.&nbsp; The quality which I
have called absolute humour is popularly supposed to be the
characteristic and special temper of the English.&nbsp; The
bustling, money <a name="page385"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
385</span>grubbing, rank-worshipping British slave of convention
claims to be the absolute humourist!&nbsp; It is very
amusing.&nbsp; The temper of absolute humour, on the contrary, is
the temper of Hotei, the fat Japanese god of &lsquo;contentment
with things as they be,&rsquo; who, when the children wake him up
from his sleep in the sunshine, and tickle and tease him, and
climb over his &lsquo;thick rotundity of belly,&rsquo;
good-naturedly bribes them to leave him in peace by telling them
fairy stories and preaching humourous homilies upon the blessings
of contentment, the richness of Nature&rsquo;s largess, the
exceeding cheapness of good things, such as sunshine and sweet
rains and the beautiful white cherry blossoms on the mountain
side.&nbsp; Between this and relative humour how wide is the
gulf!</p>
<p>That an apprehension of incongruity is the basis of both
relative and absolute humour is no doubt true enough; but while
in the case of relative humour it is the incongruity of some
departure from the normal, in the case of absolute humour it is
the sweet incongruity of the normal itself.&nbsp; Relative humour
laughs at the breach of the accustomed laws of nature and the
conventional laws of man, which laws it accepts as final.&nbsp;
Absolute humour (comparing them unconsciously with some ideal
standard of its own, or with that ideal or noumenal or spiritual
world behind the cosmic show) sees the incongruity of those very
laws themselves&mdash;laws which are the relative
humourist&rsquo;s standard.&nbsp; Absolute humour, in a word, is
based on metaphysics&mdash;relative humour on experience.&nbsp; A
child can become a relative humourist by adding a line or two to
the nose of Wellington, or by reversing the nose of the Venus de
Medici.&nbsp; The absolute humourist has so long been saying to
himself, &lsquo;What a whimsical idea is the human nose!&rsquo;
that he smiles the smile of Anarcharsis at the child&rsquo;s
laughter <a name="page386"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
386</span>on seeing it turned upside down.&nbsp; So with
convention and its codes of etiquette&mdash;from the pompous
harlequinade of royalty&mdash;the ineffable gingerbread of an
aristocracy of names without office or culture, down to the
Draconian laws of Philistia and bourgeois respectability;
whatever is a breach of the local laws of the game of social
life, whether the laws be those of a village pothouse or of
Mayfair; whether it displays an ignorance of matters of familiar
knowledge, these are the quarry of the relative humourist.&nbsp;
The absolute humourist, on the other hand, as we see in the
greatest masters of absolute humour, is so perpetually
overwhelmed with the irony of the entire game, cosmic and human,
from the droll little conventions of the village pothouse to
those of London, of Paris, of New York, of Pekin&mdash;up to the
apparently meaningless dance of the planets round the
sun&mdash;up again to that greater and more meaningless waltz of
suns round the centre&mdash;he is so delighted with the delicious
foolishness of wisdom, the conceited ignorance of knowledge, the
grotesqueness even of the standard of beauty itself; above all,
with the whim of the absolute humourist Nature, amusing herself,
not merely with her monkeys, her flamingoes, her penguins, her
dromedaries, but with these more whimsical creatures
still&mdash;these &lsquo;bipeds&rsquo; which, though
&lsquo;featherless&rsquo; are proved to be not &lsquo;plucked
fowls&rsquo;; these proud, high-thinking organisms&mdash;stomachs
with heads, arms, and legs as useful appendages&mdash;these
countless little &lsquo;me&rsquo;s,&rsquo; so all alike and yet
so unlike, each one feeling, knowing itself to be <i>the</i> me,
the only true original me, round whom all other <i>me&rsquo;s</i>
revolve&mdash;so overwhelmed is the absolute humourist with the
whim of all this&mdash;with the incongruity, that is, of the
normal itself&mdash;with the &lsquo;almighty joke&rsquo; of the
Cosmos as it is&mdash;that he sees nothing &lsquo;funny&rsquo; in
departures <a name="page387"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
387</span>from laws which to him are in themselves the very
quintessence of fun.&nbsp; And he laughs the laugh of Rabelais
and of Sterne; for he feels that behind this rich incongruous
show there must be a beneficent Showman.&nbsp; He knows that
although at the top of the constellation sits Circumstance,
Harlequin and King, bowelless and blind, shaking his starry cap
and bells, there sits far above even Harlequin himself another
Being greater than he&mdash;a Being who because he has given us
the delight of laughter must be good, and who in the end will
somewhere set all these incongruities right&mdash;who will, some
day, show us the meaning of that which now seems so
meaningless.&nbsp; With Charles Lamb he feels, in short, that
humour &lsquo;does not go out with life&rsquo;; and in answer to
Elia&rsquo;s question, &lsquo;Can a ghost laugh?&rsquo; he says,
&lsquo;Assuredly, if there be ghosts at all,&rsquo; for he is as
unable as Soame Jenyns himself to imagine that even the seraphim
can be perfectly happy without a perception of the ludicrous.</p>
<p>If this, then, is the absolute humourist as distinguished from
the relative humourist, his type is not Dickens or Cruikshank,
but Anacharsis, or, better still, that old Greek who died of
laughter from seeing a donkey eat, and who, perhaps, is the only
man who could have told us what the superlative feeling of
absolute humour really is, though he died of a sharp and sudden
recognition of the humour of the bodily functions merely.&nbsp;
And naturally what is such a perennial source of amusement to the
absolute humourist he gets to love.&nbsp; Mere representation,
therefore, is with him the be-all and the end-all of art.&nbsp;
Exaggeration offends him.&nbsp; Nothing to him is so rich as the
real.&nbsp; He pronounces Tennyson&rsquo;s &lsquo;Northern
Farmer&rsquo; or the public-house scene in &lsquo;Silas
Marner&rsquo; to be more humourous than the trial scene in
&lsquo;Pickwick.&rsquo;&nbsp; Wilkie&rsquo;s realism he finds
more humourous <a name="page388"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
388</span>than the funniest cartoon in the funniest comic
journal.&nbsp; And this mood is as much opposed to satire as to
relative humour.&nbsp; Of all moods the rarest and the
finest&mdash;requiring, indeed, such a &lsquo;blessed mixing of
the juices&rsquo; as nature cannot every day achieve&mdash;it is
the mood of each one of those fatal &lsquo;Paradis
Artificiels,&rsquo; the seeking of which has devastated the human
race: the mood of Christopher Sly, of Villon; of Walter Mapes in
the following verse:&mdash;</p>
<p>Meum est propositum in taberna mori,<br />
Vinum sit appositum morientis ori,<br />
Ut dicant cum venerint angelorum chori,<br />
Deus sit propitius huic potatori.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now it is because Mrs. Gudgeon is the very type of the
absolute humourist as defined in this magnificent fugue of prose,
and the only example of absolute humour which has appeared in
prose fiction, that she is to me a fount of esoteric and
fastidious joy.&nbsp; If I were asked what character in
&lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; shows the most unmistakable genius, I should
reply, &lsquo;Mrs. Gudgeon! and again, Mrs.
Gudgeon!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

GORGIOS AND ROMANIES</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> publication of &lsquo;The
Coming of Love&rsquo; in book form preceded that of
&lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; by about a year, but it had been appearing
piecemeal in the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; since 1882.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;So far as regards Rhona Boswell&rsquo;s
story,&rdquo; says Mr. Watts-Dunton, &ldquo;&lsquo;The Coming of
Love&rsquo; is a sequel to &lsquo;Aylwin.&rsquo;&nbsp; If the
allusions to Rhona&rsquo;s lover, Percy Aylwin, in the prose
story have been, in some degree, misunderstood by some
readers&mdash;if there is any danger of Henry Aylwin, the hero of
the novel, being confounded with Percy Aylwin, the hero of this
poem&mdash;it only shows how difficult it is for the poet or the
novelist (who must needs see his characters from the concave side
only) to realize that it is the convex side only which he can
present to his reader.</p>
<p>The fact is that the motive of
&lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo;&mdash;dealing only as it does with that
which is elemental and unchangeable in man&mdash;is of so
entirely poetic a nature that I began to write it in verse.&nbsp;
After a while, however, I found that a story of so many incidents
and complications as the one that was growing under my hand could
only be told in prose.&nbsp; This was before I had written any
prose at all&mdash;yes, it is so long ago as that.&nbsp; And
when, afterwards, I began to write criticism, I had (for certain
reasons&mdash;important then, but of no importance now) abandoned
the idea of offering the novel to the <a name="page390"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 390</span>outside public at all.&nbsp; Among
my friends it had been widely read, both in manuscript and in
type.</p>
<p>But with regard to Romany women, Henry Aylwin&rsquo;s feeling
towards them was the very opposite of Percy&rsquo;s.&nbsp; When,
in speaking of George Borrow some years ago, I made the remark
that between Englishmen of a certain type and gypsy women there
is an extraordinary physical attraction&mdash;an attraction which
did not exist between Borrow and the gypsy women with whom he was
brought into contact&mdash;I was thinking specially of the
character depicted here under the name of Percy Aylwin.&nbsp; And
I asked then the question&mdash;Supposing Borrow to have been
physically drawn with much power towards any woman, could she
possibly have been Romany?&nbsp; Would she not rather have been
of the Scandinavian type?&mdash;would she not have been what he
used to call a &lsquo;Brynhild&rsquo;?&nbsp; From many
conversations with him on this subject, I think she must
necessarily have been a tall blonde of the type of Isopel
Berners&mdash;who, by-the-by, was much more a portrait of a
splendid East-Anglian road-girl than is generally imagined.&nbsp;
And I think, besides, that Borrow&rsquo;s sympathy with the
Anglo-Saxon type may account for the fact that, notwithstanding
his love of the free and easy economies of life among the better
class of Gryengroes, his gypsy women are all what have been
called &lsquo;scenic characters.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When he comes to delineate a heroine, she is the superb Isopel
Berners&mdash;that is to say, she is physically (and indeed
mentally, too), the very opposite of the Romany chi.&nbsp; It was
here, as I happen to know, that Borrow&rsquo;s sympathies were
with Henry Aylwin far more than with Percy Aylwin.</p>
<p>The type of the Romany chi, though very delightful to Henry
Aylwin as regards companionship, had no physical <a
name="page391"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 391</span>attractions
for him, otherwise the witchery of the girl here called Rhona
Boswell, whom he knew as a child long before Percy Aylwin knew
her, must surely have eclipsed such charms as Winifred Wynne or
any other winsome &lsquo;Gorgie&rsquo; could possess.&nbsp; On
the other hand, it would, I believe, have been impossible for
Percy Aylwin to be brought closely and long in contact with a
Romany girl like Sinfi Lovell and remain untouched by those
unique physical attractions of hers&mdash;attractions that made
her universally admired by the best judges of female beauty as
being the most splendid &lsquo;face-model&rsquo; of her time, and
as being in form the grandest woman ever seen in the
studios&mdash;attractions that upon Henry Aylwin seem to have
made almost no impression.</p>
<p>There is no accounting for this, as there is no accounting for
anything connected with the mysterious witchery of sex.&nbsp; And
again, the strong inscrutable way in which some gypsy girls are
drawn towards a &lsquo;Tarno Rye&rsquo; (as a young English
gentleman is called), is quite inexplicable.&nbsp; Some have
thought&mdash;and Borrow was one of them&mdash;that it may arise
from that infirmity of the Romany Chal which causes the girls to
&lsquo;take their own part&rsquo; without appealing to their
men-companions for aid&mdash;that lack of masculine chivalry
among the men of their own race.</p>
<p>And now for a word or two upon a matter in connection with
&lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Coming of Love&rsquo; which
interests me more deeply.&nbsp; Some of those who have been
specially attracted towards Sinfi Lovell have had misgivings, I
find, as to whether she is not an idealization, an impossible
Romany chi, and some of those who have been specially attracted
towards Rhona Boswell have had the same misgivings as to her.</p>
<p>One of the great racial specialities of the Romany <a
name="page392"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 392</span>is the
superiority of the women to the men.&nbsp; For it is not merely
in intelligence, in imagination, in command over language, in
comparative breadth of view regarding the Gorgio world that the
Romany women (in Great Britain, at least) leave the men far
behind.&nbsp; In everything that goes to make nobility of
character this superiority is equally noticeable.&nbsp; To
imagine a gypsy hero is, I will confess, rather difficult.&nbsp;
Not that the average male gypsy is without a certain amount of
courage, but it soon gives way, and, in a conflict between a
gypsy and an Englishman, it always seems as though ages of
oppression have damped the virility of Romany stamina.</p>
<p>Although some of our most notable prize-fighters have been
gypsies, it used to be well known, in times when the ring was
fashionable, that a gypsy could not always be relied upon to
&lsquo;take punishment&rsquo; with the stolid indifference of an
Englishman or a negro, partly, perhaps, because his more
highly-strung nervous system makes him more sensitive to
pain.</p>
<p>The courage of a gypsy woman, on the other hand, has passed
into a proverb; nothing seems to daunt it.&nbsp; This superiority
of the women to the men extends to everything, unless, perhaps,
we except that gift of music for which the gypsies as a race are
noticeable.&nbsp; With regard to music, however, even in Eastern
Europe (Russia alone excepted), where gypsy music is so universal
that, according to some writers, every Hungarian musician is of
Romany extraction, it is the men, and not, in general, the women,
who excel.&nbsp; Those, however, who knew Sinfi Lovell may think
with me that this state of things may simply be the result of
opportunity and training.&rdquo;</p>

&lsquo;THE COMING OF LOVE&rsquo;</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> my article on Mr. Watts-Dunton
in Chambers&rsquo;s &lsquo;Cyclop&aelig;dia of English
Literature&rsquo; I devoted most of my space to &lsquo;The Coming
of Love.&rsquo;&nbsp; I put the two great romantic poems
&lsquo;The Coming of Love&rsquo; and &lsquo;Christmas at the
&ldquo;Mermaid&rdquo;&rsquo; far above everything he has
done.&nbsp; I think I see both in the conception and in the
execution of these poems the promise of immortality&mdash;if
immortality can be predicted of any poems of our time.&nbsp; In
reading them one remembers in a flash Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s
own noble words about the poetic impulse:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In order to produce poetry the soul must
for the time being have reached that state of exaltation, that
state of freedom from self-consciousness, depicted in the
lines&mdash;</p>
<p>I started once, or seemed to start, in pain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Resolved on noble things, and strove to speak,<br />
As when a great thought strikes along the brain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And flushes all the cheek.</p>
<p>Whatsoever may be the poet&rsquo;s &lsquo;knowledge of his
art,&rsquo; into this mood he must always pass before he can
write a truly poetic line.&nbsp; For, notwithstanding all that we
have said and are going to say upon poetry as a fine art, it is
in the deepest sense of the word an &lsquo;inspiration&rsquo;
indeed.&nbsp; No man can write a line of genuine poetry <a
name="page394"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 394</span>without
having been &lsquo;born again&rsquo; (or, as the true rendering
of the text says, &lsquo;born from above&rsquo;); and then the
mastery over those highest reaches of form which are beyond the
ken of the mere versifier comes to him as a result of the
change.&nbsp; Hence, with all Mrs. Browning&rsquo;s metrical
blemishes, the splendour of her metrical triumphs at her
best.</p>
<p>For what is the deep distinction between poet and
proseman?&nbsp; A writer may be many things besides a poet; he
may be a warrior like &AElig;schylus, a man of business like
Shakespeare, a courtier like Chaucer, or a cosmopolitan
philosopher like Goethe; but the moment the poetic mood is upon
him all the trappings of the world with which for years he may
perhaps have been clothing his soul&mdash;the world&rsquo;s
knowingness, its cynicism, its self-seeking, its
ambition&mdash;fall away, and the man becomes an inspired child
again, with ears attuned to nothing but the whispers of those
spirits from the Golden Age, who, according to Hesiod, haunt and
bless the degenerate earth.&nbsp; What such a man produces may
greatly delight and astonish his readers, yet not so greatly as
it delights and astonishes himself.&nbsp; His passages of pathos
draw no tears so deep or so sweet as those that fall from his own
eyes while he writes; his sublime passages overawe no soul so
imperiously as his own; his humour draws no laughter so rich or
so deep as that stirred within his own breast.</p>
<p>It might almost be said, indeed, that Sincerity and
Conscience, the two angels that bring to the poet the wonders of
the poetic dream, bring him also the deepest, truest delight of
form.&nbsp; It might almost be said that by aid of sincerity and
conscience the poet is enabled to see more clearly than other men
the eternal limits of his own art&mdash;to see with Sophocles
that nothing, not even poetry <a name="page395"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 395</span>itself, is of any worth to man,
invested as he is by the whole army of evil, unless it is in the
deepest and highest sense good, unless it comes linking us all
together by closer bonds of sympathy and pity, strengthening us
to fight the foes with whom fate and even nature, the mother who
bore us, sometimes seem in league&mdash;to see with Milton that
the high quality of man&rsquo;s soul which in English is
expressed by the word virtue is greater than even the great poem
he prized, greater than all the rhythms of all the tongues that
have been spoken since Babel&mdash;and to see with Shakespeare
and with Shelley that the high passion which in England is called
love is lovelier than all art, lovelier than all the marble
Mercuries that &lsquo;await the chisel of the sculptor&rsquo; in
all the marble hills.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason why the criticism of the hour does not always give
Mr. Watts-Dunton the place accorded to him by his great
contemporaries is not any lack of generosity: it arises from the
unprecedented, not to say eccentric, way in which his poetry has
reached the public.&nbsp; In this respect alone, apart from its
great originality, &lsquo;The Coming of Love&rsquo; is a
curiosity of literature.&nbsp; I know nothing in the least like
the history of this poem.&nbsp; It was written, circulated in
manuscript among the very elite of English letters, and indeed
partly published in the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um,&rsquo; very nearly
a quarter of a century ago.&nbsp; I have before alluded to Mrs.
Chandler Moulton&rsquo;s introduction to Philip Bourke
Marston&rsquo;s poems, where she says that it was Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s poetry which won for him the friendship of
Tennyson, Rossetti, Morris, and Swinburne.&nbsp; Yet for lustre
after lustre it was persistently withheld from the public;
cenacle after poetic cenacle rose, prospered and faded away, and
still <a name="page396"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
396</span>this poet, who was talked of by all the poets and
called &lsquo;the friend of all the poets,&rsquo; kept his work
back until he had passed middle age.&nbsp; Then, at last, owing I
believe to the energetic efforts of Mr. John Lane, who had been
urging the matter for something like five years, he launched a
volume which seized upon the public taste and won a very great
success so far as sales go.&nbsp; It is now in its sixth
edition.&nbsp; There can be no doubt whatever that if the book
had appeared, as it ought to have appeared, at the time it was
written, critics would have classed the poet among his compeers
and he would have come down to the present generation, as
Swinburne has come down, as a classic.&nbsp; But, as I have said,
it is not in the least surprising that, notwithstanding
Rossetti&rsquo;s intense admiration of the poem, notwithstanding
the fact that Morris intended to print it at the Kelmscott Press,
and notwithstanding the fact that Swinburne, in dedicating the
collected edition of his works to Mr. Watts-Dunton, addresses him
as a poet of the greatest authority&mdash;it is only the true
critics who see in the right perspective a poet who has so
perversely neglected his chances.&nbsp; If his time of
recognition has not yet fully come, this generation is not to
blame.&nbsp; The poet can blame only himself, although to judge
by Rossetti&rsquo;s words, and by the following lines from Dr.
Hake&rsquo;s &lsquo;New Day,&rsquo; he is indifferent to
that:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>You tell me life is all too rich and brief,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Too various, too delectable a game,<br />
To give to art, entirely or in chief;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And love of Nature quells the thirst for fame.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &lsquo;parable poet&rsquo; then goes on to give voice to
the opinion, not only of himself, but of most of the great poets
of the mid-Victorian epoch:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page397"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
397</span>You who in youth the cone-paved forest sought,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Musing until the pines to musing fell;<br />
You who by river-path the witchery caught<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of waters moving under stress of spell;<br />
You who the seas of metaphysics crossed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet returned to art&rsquo;s consoling
haven&mdash;<br />
Returned from whence so many souls are lost,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With wisdom&rsquo;s seal upon your forehead
graven&mdash;<br />
Well may you now abandon learning&rsquo;s seat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And work the ore all seek, not many find;<br />
No sign-post need you to direct your feet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You draw no riches from another&rsquo;s mind.<br />
Hail Nature&rsquo;s coming; bygone be the past;<br />
Hail her New Day; it breaks for man at last.</p>
<p>Fulfil the new-born dream of Poesy!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Give her your life in full, she turns from
less&mdash;<br />
Your life in full&mdash;like those who did not die,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though death holds all they sang in dark duress.<br
/>
You, knowing Nature to the throbbing core,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You can her wordless prophecies rehearse.<br />
The murmers others heard her heart outpour<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Swell to an anthem in your richer verse.<br />
If wider vision brings a wider scope<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For art, and depths profounder for emotion,<br />
Yours be the song whose master-tones shall ope<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A new poetic heaven o&rsquo;er earth and ocean.<br
/>
The New Day comes apace; its virgin fame<br />
Be yours, to fan the fiery soul to flame.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, he has often said to me: &lsquo;There is a tide in the
affairs of men, and I did not throw myself upon my little tide
until it was too late, and I am not going to repine
now.&rsquo;&nbsp; For my part, I have been a student of English
poetry all my life&mdash;it is my chief subject of
study&mdash;and I predict that when poetic imagination is again
perceived to be the supreme poetic gift, Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s
genius will be acclaimed.&nbsp; In respect of <a
name="page398"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 398</span>imaginative
power, apart from the other poetic qualities&mdash;&lsquo;the
power of seeing a dramatic situation and flashing it upon the
physical senses of the listener,&rsquo; none of his
contemporaries have surpassed him.</p>
<p>I have said in print more than once that I, a Celt myself, can
see more Celtic glamour in his poetry than in many of the Celtic
poets of our time.&nbsp; And, if we are to judge by the vogue of
&lsquo;The Coming of Love&rsquo; and &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; in
Wales, the Welsh people seem to see it very clearly.&nbsp; Take,
for instance, the sonnet called &lsquo;The Mirrored Stars&rsquo;
again, given on page 29.&nbsp; It is impossible for Celtic
glamour to go further than this; and yet it is rarely noted by
critics in discussing the Celtic note in poetry.</p>
<p>In order fully to understand &lsquo;The Coming of Love&rsquo;
it is necessary to bear in mind a distinction between the two
kinds of poetry upon which Mr. Watts-Dunton has often
dwelt.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are,&rdquo; he tells us, &ldquo;but two
kinds of poetry, but two kinds of art&mdash;that which
interprets, and that which represents.&nbsp; &lsquo;Poetry is
apparent pictures of unapparent realities,&rsquo; says the
Eastern mind through Zoroaster; &lsquo;the highest, the only
operation of art is representation (Gestaltung),&rsquo; says the
Western mind through Goethe.&nbsp; Both are right.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Madame Galimberti has called Mr. Watts-Dunton &lsquo;the poet of
the sunrise&rsquo;: There are richer descriptions of sunrise in
&lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Coming of Love&rsquo; than in
any other writer I know.&nbsp; &ldquo;Few poets,&rdquo; Mr.
Watts-Dunton says, &ldquo;have been successful in painting a
sunrise, for the simple reason that, save through the
bed-curtains, they do not often see one.&nbsp; They think that
all they have to do is to paint a sunset, which they sometimes do
see, and call it a sunrise.&nbsp; They are entirely mistaken,
however; the two phenomena are both <a name="page399"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 399</span>like and unlike.&nbsp; Between the
cloud-pageantry of sunrise and of sunset the difference to the
student of Nature is as apparent as is the difference to the poet
between the various forms of his art.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Coming of Love&rsquo; shows that independence of
contemporary vogues and influences which characterizes all Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s work, whether in verse or prose, whether in
romance or criticism, or in that analysis and exposition of the
natural history of minds about which Sainte Beuve speaks.&nbsp;
It was as a poet that his energies were first exercised, but this
for a long time was known only to his poetical friends.&nbsp; His
criticism came many years afterwards, and, as Rossetti used to
say, &lsquo;his critical work consists of generalizations of his
own experience in the poet&rsquo;s workshop.&rsquo;&nbsp; For
many years he was known only in his capacity as a critic.&nbsp;
James Russell Lowell is reported to have said: &lsquo;Our ablest
critics hitherto have been 18-carat; Theodore Watts goes nearer
the pure article.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. William Sharp, in his study of
Rossetti, says: &lsquo;In every sense of the word the friendship
thus begun resulted in the greatest benefit to the elder writer,
the latter having greater faith in Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s
literary judgment than seems characteristic with so dominant and
individual an intellect as that of Rossetti.&nbsp; Although the
latter knew well the sonnet-literature of Italy and England, and
was a much-practised master of the heart&rsquo;s key himself, I
have heard him on many occasions refer to Theodore Watts as
having still more thorough knowledge on the subject, and as being
the most original sonnet-writer living.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Coming of Love&rsquo; are
vitally connected with the poet&rsquo;s peculiar critical
message.&nbsp; Henry Aylwin and Percy Aylwin may be regarded as
the embodiment of his philosophy of life.&nbsp; The very
popularity <a name="page400"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
400</span>of &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Coming of
Love&rsquo; is apt to make readers forget the profundity of the
philosophical thought upon which they are based, although this
profundity has been indicated by such competent critics as Dr.
Robertson Nicoll in the &lsquo;Contemporary Review,&rsquo; M.
Maurice Muret in the &lsquo;Journal des D&eacute;bats,&rsquo; and
other thoughtful writers.&nbsp; Upon the inner meaning of the
romance and the poem I have, however, ideas of my own to express,
which are not in full accordance with any previous
criticisms.&nbsp; To me it seems that the two cousins, Henry
Aylwin of the romance, and Percy Aylwin of the poem, are phases
of a modern Hamlet, a Hamlet who has travelled past the pathetic
superstitions of the old cosmogonies to the last milestone of
doubting hope and questioning fear, a Hamlet who stands at the
portals of the outer darkness, gazing with eyes made wistful by
the loss of a beloved woman.&nbsp; In both the romance and the
poem the theme is love at war with death.&nbsp; Mr. Watts-Dunton,
in his preface to the illustrated edition of &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo;
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is a story written as a comment on
Love&rsquo;s warfare with death&mdash;written to show that,
confronted as man is every moment by signs of the fragility and
brevity of human life, the great marvel connected with him is not
that his thoughts dwell frequently upon the unknown country
beyond Orion, where the beloved dead are loving us still, but
that he can find time and patience to think upon anything else: a
story written further to show how terribly despair becomes
intensified when a man has lost&mdash;or thinks he has
lost&mdash;a woman whose love was the only light of his
world&mdash;when his soul is torn from his body, as it were, and
whisked off on the wings of the &lsquo;viewless winds&rsquo;
right away beyond the farthest star, till <a
name="page401"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 401</span>the
universe hangs beneath his feet a trembling point of twinkling
light, and at last even this dies away and his soul cries out for
help in that utter darkness and loneliness.&nbsp; It was to
depict this phase of human emotion that both &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo;
and &lsquo;The Coming of Love&rsquo; were written.&nbsp; They
were missives from the lonely watch-tower of the writer&rsquo;s
soul, sent out into the strange and busy battle of the
world&mdash;sent out to find, if possible, another soul or two to
whom the watcher was, without knowing it, akin.&nbsp; In
&lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; the problem is symbolized by the victory of
love over sinister circumstance, whereas in the poem it is
symbolized by a mystical dream of &lsquo;Natura
Benigna.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In &lsquo;The Coming of Love&rsquo; Percy Aylwin is a poet and
a sailor, with such an absorbing love for the sea that he has no
room for any other passion; to him an imprisoned seabird is a
sufferer almost more pitiable than any imprisoned man, as will be
seen by the opening section of the poem, &lsquo;Mother
Carey&rsquo;s Chicken.&rsquo;&nbsp; On seeing a storm-petrel in a
cage on a cottage wall near Gypsy Dell, he takes down the cage in
order to release the bird; then, carrying the bird in the cage,
he turns to cross a rustic wooden bridge leading past Gypsy Dell,
when he suddenly comes upon a landsman friend of his, a Romany
Rye, who is just parting from a young gypsy-girl.&nbsp; Gazing at
her beauty, Percy stands dazzled and forgets the petrel.&nbsp; It
is symbolical of the inner meaning of the story that the bird now
flies away through the half-open door.&nbsp; From that moment,
through the magic of love, the land to Percy is richer than the
sea: this ends the first phase of the story.&nbsp; The first kiss
between the two lovers is thus described:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page402"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
402</span>If only in dreams may Man be fully blest,<br />
Is heaven a dream?&nbsp; Is she I claspt a dream?<br />
Or stood she here even now where dew-drops gleam<br />
And miles of furze shine yellow down the West?<br />
I seem to clasp her still&mdash;still on my breast<br />
Her bosom beats: I see the bright eyes beam.<br />
I think she kissed these lips, for now they seem<br />
Scarce mine: so hallowed of the lips they pressed.<br />
Yon thicket&rsquo;s breath&mdash;can that be eglantine?<br />
Those birds&mdash;can they be Morning&rsquo;s choristers?<br />
Can this be Earth?&nbsp; Can these be banks of furze?<br />
Like burning bushes fired of God they shine!<br />
I seem to know them, though this body of mine<br />
Passed into spirit at the touch of hers!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Percy stays with the gypsies, and the gypsy-girl, Rhona,
teaches him Romany.&nbsp; This arouses the jealousy of a gypsy
rival&mdash;Herne the &lsquo;Scollard.&rsquo;&nbsp; Percy
Aylwin&rsquo;s family afterwards succeeds in separating him from
her, and he is again sent to sea.&nbsp; While cruising among the
coral islands he receives the letter from Rhona which paints her
character with unequalled vividness:&mdash;</p>

</table>
<p>Percy returns to England and reaches Gypsy Dell at the very
moment when &lsquo;the Schollard,&rsquo; maddened by the
discovery that Rhona is to meet Percy that night, has drawn his
knife upon the girl under the starlight by the river-bank.&nbsp;
Percy on one side of the river witnesses the death-struggle on
the other side without being able to go to Rhona&rsquo;s
assistance.&nbsp; But the girl hurls her antagonist into the
water, and he is drowned.&nbsp; There are other
witnesses&mdash;the stars, whose reflected light, according to a
gypsy superstition, writes in the water, just above where the
drowned man sank, mysterious runes, telling the story of the
deed.&nbsp; For a Romany woman who marries a Gorgio the penalty
is death.&nbsp; Nevertheless, Rhona marries Percy.&nbsp; I will
quote the sonnets describing Rhona as she wakes in the tent at
dawn:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>The young light peeps through yonder trembling
chink<br />
The tent&rsquo;s mouth makes in answer to a breeze;<br />
The rooks outside are stirring in the trees<br />
Through which I see the deepening bars of pink.<br />
I hear the earliest anvil&rsquo;s tingling clink<br />
From Jasper&rsquo;s forge; the cattle on the leas<br />
Begin to low.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s waking by degrees:<br />
<a name="page406"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
406</span>Sleep&rsquo;s rosy fetters melt, but link by link.<br
/>
What dream is hers?&nbsp; Her eyelids shake with tears;<br />
The fond eyes open now like flowers in dew:<br />
She sobs I know not what of passionate fears:<br />
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never leave me now?&nbsp; There is but
you;<br />
I dreamt a voice was whispering in my ears,<br />
&lsquo;The Dukkeripen o&rsquo; stars comes ever
true.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rises, startled by a wandering bee<br />
Buzzing around her brow to greet the girl:<br />
She draws the tent wide open with a swirl,<br />
And, as she stands to breathe the fragrancy<br />
Beneath the branches of the hawthorn tree&mdash;<br />
Whose dews fall on her head like beads of pearl,<br />
Or drops of sunshine firing tress and curl&mdash;<br />
The Spirit of the Sunrise speaks to me,<br />
And says, &lsquo;This bride of yours, I know her well,<br />
And so do all the birds in all the bowers<br />
Who mix their music with the breath of flowers<br />
When greetings rise from river, heath and dell.<br />
See, on the curtain of the morning haze<br />
The Future&rsquo;s finger writes of happy days.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rhona, half-hidden by &lsquo;the branches of the hawthorn
tree,&rsquo; stretches up to kiss the white and green May buds
overhanging the bridal tent, while Percy Aylwin stands at the
tent&rsquo;s mouth and looks at her:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Can this be she, who, on that fateful day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When Romany knives leapt out at me like stings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hurled back the men, who shrank like stricken
things<br />
From Rhona&rsquo;s eyes, whose lightnings seemed to slay?<br />
Can this be she, half-hidden in the may,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Kissing the buds for &lsquo;luck o&rsquo;
love&rsquo; it brings,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While from the dingle grass the skylark springs<br
/>
And merle and mavis answer finch and jay?</p>
<p style="text-align: right">[He goes up to the hawthorn, pulls
the branches<br />
apart, and clasps her in his arms.</p>
<p><a name="page407"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 407</span>Can
she here, covering with her childish kisses<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; These pearly buds&mdash;can she so soft, so
tender,<br />
So shaped for clasping&mdash;dowered of all
love-blisses&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Be my fierce girl whose love for me would send
her,<br />
An angel storming hell, through death&rsquo;s abysses,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where never a sight could fright or power could bend
her?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Rhona is haunted by forebodings, and one night when the
lovers are on the river she reads the scripture of the
stars.&nbsp; I must give here the sonnet quoted on page
29:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>The mirrored stars lit all the bulrush-spears,<br
/>
And all the flags and broad-leaved lily-isles;<br />
The ripples shook the stars to golden smiles,<br />
Then smoothed them back to happy golden spheres.<br />
We rowed&mdash;we sang; her voice seemed in mine ears<br />
An angel&rsquo;s, yet with woman&rsquo;s dearer wiles;<br />
But shadows fell from gathering cloudy piles<br />
And ripples shook the stars to fiery tears.</p>
<p>What shaped those shadows like another boat<br />
Where Rhona sat and he Love made a liar?<br />
There, where the Scollard sank, I saw it float,<br />
While ripples shook the stars to symbols dire;<br />
We wept&mdash;we kissed&mdash;while starry fingers wrote,<br />
And ripples shook the stars to a snake of fire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most tragically dramatic scene in the poem is that in
which Percy confronts the cosmic mystery, defying its
menace.&nbsp; The stars write in the river:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Falsehold can never shield her: Truth is
strong.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Percy reads the rune and answers:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>I read your rune: is there no pity, then,<br />
In Heav&rsquo;n that wove this net of life for men?<br />
Have only Hell and Falsehood heart for ruth?<br />
Show me, ye mirrored stars, this tyrant Truth&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; King that can do no wrong!<br />
Ah!&nbsp; Night seems opening!&nbsp; There, above the skies,<br
/>
<a name="page408"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 408</span>Who sits
upon that central sun for throne<br />
Round which a golden sand of worlds is strown,<br />
Stretching right onward to an endless ocean,<br />
Far, far away, of living, dazzling motion?<br />
Hearken, King Truth, with pictures in thine eyes<br />
Mirrored from gates beyond the furthest portal<br />
Of infinite light, &rsquo;tis Love that stands immortal,<br />
The King of Kings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The gypsies read the starry rune, and, discovering
Rhona&rsquo;s secret, secretly slay her.&nbsp; Percy, having
returned to Gypsy Dell, vainly tries to find her grave.&nbsp;
Then he flies from the dingle, lest the memory of Rhona should
drive him mad, and lives alone in the Alps, where he passes into
the strange ecstasy, described in the sonnet called &lsquo;Natura
Maligna,&rsquo; which has been much discussed by the
critics:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>The Lady of the Hills with crimes untold<br />
Followed my feet with azure eyes of prey;<br />
By glacier-brink she stood&mdash;by cataract-spray&mdash;<br />
When mists were dire, or avalanche-echoes rolled.<br />
At night she glimmered in the death-wind cold,<br />
And if a footprint shone at break of day,<br />
My flesh would quail, but straight my soul would say:<br />
&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis hers whose hand God&rsquo;s mightier hand doth
hold.&rsquo;<br />
I trod her snow-bridge, for the moon was bright,<br />
Her icicle-arch across the sheer crevasse,<br />
When lo, she stood! . . .&nbsp; God made her let me pass,<br />
Then felled the bridge! . . .&nbsp; Oh, there in sallow light,<br
/>
There down the chasm, I saw her cruel, white,<br />
And all my wondrous days as in a glass.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This awful vision, quick with supernatural seership, is unique
in poetry.&nbsp; Sir George Birdwood, the orientalist, wrote in
the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; of February 5, 1881: &ldquo;Even
in its very epithets it is just such a hymn as a Hindu Puritan
(Saivite) would address to Kali (&lsquo;the malignant&rsquo;) <a
name="page409"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 409</span>or Parvati
(&lsquo;the mountaineer&rsquo;).&nbsp; It is to be delivered from
her that Hindus shriek to God in the delirium of their
fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then we are shown Percy standing at midnight in front of his
hut, while New Year&rsquo;s morning is breaking:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Through Fate&rsquo;s mysterious warp another
weft<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of days is cast; and see!&nbsp; Time&rsquo;s
star-built throne,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From which he greets a new-born year, is shown<br />
Between yon curtains where the clouds are cleft!<br />
Old Year, while here I stand, with heart bereft<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of all that was its music&mdash;stand alone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Remembering happy hours for ever flown,<br />
Impatient of the leaden minutes left&mdash;</p>
<p>The plaudits of mankind that once gave pleasure,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The chidings of mankind that once gave pain,<br />
Seem in this hermit hut beyond all measure<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Barren and foolish, and I cry, &lsquo;No grain,<br
/>
No grain, but winnowings in the harvest sieve!&rsquo;<br />
And yet I cannot join the dead&mdash;and live.</p>
<p>Old Year, what bells are ringing in the New<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In England, heedless of the knells they ring<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To you and those whose sorrow makes you cling<br />
Each to the other ere you say adieu!&mdash;<br />
I seem to hear their chimes&mdash;the chimes we knew<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In those dear days when Rhona used to sing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Greeting a New Year&rsquo;s Day as bright of wing<br
/>
As this whose pinions soon will rise to view.</p>
<p>If these dream-bells which come and mock mine ears<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Could bring the past and make it live again,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea, live with every hour of grief and pain,<br />
And hopes deferred and all the grievous fears&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And with the past bring her I weep in vain&mdash;<br
/>
Then would I bless them, though I blessed in tears.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">[The clouds move away and show
the<br />
stars in dazzling brightness.</p>
<p>Those stars! they set my rebel-pulses beating<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Against the tyrant Sorrow, him who drove<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="page410"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
410</span>My footsteps from the Dell and haunted Grove&mdash;<br
/>
They bring the mighty Mother&rsquo;s new-year greeting:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;All save great Nature is a vision
fleeting&rsquo;&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So says the scripture of those orbs above.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;All, all,&rsquo; I cry, &lsquo;except
man&rsquo;s dower of love!&mdash;<br />
Love is no child of Nature&rsquo;s mystic cheating!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And yet it comes again, the old desire<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To read what yonder constellations write<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On river and ocean&mdash;secrets of the
night&mdash;<br />
To feel again the spirit&rsquo;s wondering fire<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which, ere this passion came, absorbed me
quite,<br />
To catch the master-note of Nature&rsquo;s lyre.</p>
<p>New Year, the stars do not forget the Old!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet they say to me, most sorely stung<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By Fate and Death, &lsquo;Nature is ever young,<br
/>
Clad in new riches, as each morning&rsquo;s gold<br />
Blooms o&rsquo;er a blasted land: be thou consoled:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Past was great, his harp was greatly strung;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Past was great, his songs were greatly sung;<br
/>
The Past was great, his tales were greatly told;</p>
<p>The Past has given to man a wondrous world,<br />
But curtains of old Night were being upcurled<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst thou wast mourning Rhona; things sublime<br
/>
In worlds of worlds were breaking on the sight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Youth&rsquo;s fresh runners in the lists of
Time.<br />
Arise, and drink the wine of Nature&rsquo;s light!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, a dream prepares the sorrowing lover for the true
reading of &lsquo;The Promise of the Sunrise&rsquo; and the
revelation of &lsquo;Natura Benigna&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Beneath the loveliest dream there coils a fear:<br
/>
Last night came she whose eyes are memories now;<br />
Her far-off gaze seemed all forgetful how<br />
Love dimmed them once, so calm they shone and clear.<br />
&lsquo;Sorrow,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;has made me old, my dear;<br
/>
&rsquo;Tis I, indeed, but grief can change the brow:<br />
Beneath my load a seraph&rsquo;s neck might bow,<br />
<a name="page411"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 411</span>Vigils
like mine would blanch an angel&rsquo;s hair.&rsquo;<br />
Oh, then I saw, I saw the sweet lips move!<br />
I saw the love-mists thickening in her eyes&mdash;<br />
I heard a sound as if a murmuring dove<br />
Felt lonely in the dells of Paradise;<br />
But when upon my neck she fell, my love,<br />
Her hair smelt sweet of whin and woodland spice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And now &lsquo;Natura Benigna&rsquo; reveals to him her mystic
consolation:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>What power is this?&nbsp; What witchery wins my
feet<br />
To peaks so sheer they scorn the cloaking snow,<br />
All silent as the emerald gulfs below,<br />
Down whose ice-walls the wings of twilight beat?<br />
What thrill of earth and heaven&mdash;most wild, most
sweet&mdash;<br />
What answering pulse that all the senses know,<br />
Comes leaping from the ruddy eastern glow<br />
Where, far away, the skies and mountains meet?<br />
Mother, &rsquo;tis I, reborn: I know thee well:<br />
That throb I know and all it prophesies,<br />
O Mother and Queen, beneath the olden spell<br />
Of silence, gazing from thy hills and skies!<br />
Dumb Mother, struggling with the years to tell<br />
The secret at thy heart through helpless eyes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not the pathetic fallacy.&nbsp; It is the poetic
interpretation of the latest discovery of science, to wit, that
dead matter is alive, and that the universe is an infinite
stammering and whispering, that may be heard only by the
poet&rsquo;s finer ear.</p>
<p>The extracts I have given are sufficient to show the
originality of Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s poetry, both in subject
and in form.&nbsp; The originality of any poet is seen, not in
fantastic metrical experiments, but rather in new and original
treatment of the metres natural to the genius of the
language.&nbsp; In &lsquo;The Coming of Love&rsquo; the poet has
invented a new poetic form.&nbsp; Its object is to combine <a
name="page412"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 412</span>the
advantages and to avoid the disadvantages of lyrical narrative,
of poetic drama, of the prose novel, and of the prose play.&nbsp;
In Tennyson&rsquo;s &lsquo;Maud&rsquo; and in Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s other lyrical drama, &ldquo;Christmas at the
&lsquo;Mermaid,&rsquo;&rdquo; the special functions of all the
above mentioned forms are knit together in a new form.&nbsp; The
story is told by brief pictures.&nbsp; In &lsquo;The Coming of
Love&rsquo; this method reaches its perfection.&nbsp; Lyrics,
songs, elegaic quatrains, and sonnets, are used according to an
inner law of the poet&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; The exaltation of these
moments is intensified by the business parts of the narrative
being summarized in bare prose.&nbsp; The interplay of thought,
mood, and passion is revealed wholly by swift lyrical
visions.&nbsp; In Dante&rsquo;s &lsquo;Vita Nuova&rsquo; a method
something like this is adopted, but there the links are in a kind
of poetical prose akin to the verse, and as Dante&rsquo;s poems
are all sonnets, there is no harmonic scheme of metrical music
like that in &lsquo;The Coming of Love.&rsquo;&nbsp; Here the
very &lsquo;rhyme-colour&rsquo; and the subtle variety of vowel
sounds from beginning to end are evidently part of the metrical
composition.&nbsp; Wagner&rsquo;s music is the only modern
art-form which is comparable with the metrical architecture of
&lsquo;The Coming of Love,&rsquo; and &ldquo;Christmas at the
&lsquo;Mermaid.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; No one can fully understand
the rhythmic triumph of these great poems who has not studied it
by the light of Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s theory of elaborate
rhythmic effects in music formulated in his treatise on Poetry in
the &lsquo;Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica&rsquo;&mdash;a theory
which shows that metrical and rhythmical art, as compared with
the art of music, is still developing.&nbsp; Both these lyrical
dramas ought to be carefully studied by all students of English
metres.</p>
<p>The novelty of these forms is not a fortuitous eccentricity,
<a name="page413"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 413</span>but an
extremely valuable experiment in a new kind of dramatic
poetry.&nbsp; It is remarkable that in this new and difficult
form the poet has achieved in Rhona Boswell a feat of
characterization quite without parallel under such
conditions.&nbsp; Rhona is so vivid that it is hardly fair to
hang her portrait on the same wall as those of the ordinary
heroines of poetry.&nbsp; But if, for the sake of comparison,
Rhona be set beside Tennyson&rsquo;s Maud, the difference is
startling.&nbsp; Maud does not tingle with personality.&nbsp; She
is a type, an abstraction, a common denominator of &lsquo;creamy
English girls.&rsquo;&nbsp; Rhona, on the other hand, is
nervously alive with personality.&nbsp; One makes pictures of her
in one&rsquo;s brain&mdash;pictures that never become blurred,
pictures that do not run into other pictures of other poetic
heroines.&nbsp; How much of this is due to the poetic form?&nbsp;
Could Rhona have lived so intensely in a novel or a play?&nbsp; I
do not think so.&nbsp; At any rate, she lives with incomparable
vitality in this lyrical drama-novel, and therefore the poetic
vehicle in which she rushes upon our vision is well worth the
study of critics and craftsmen.&nbsp; Mr. Kernahan has called
attention to the baldness of the enlinking prose narrative.&nbsp;
Perhaps this defect could be remedied by using a more poetic and
more romantic prose like that of the opening of
&lsquo;Aylwin,&rsquo; which would lead the imagination insensibly
from one situation or mood to another.</p>
<p>In connection with the opening sonnets of &lsquo;The Coming of
Love,&rsquo; a very interesting point of criticism presents
itself.&nbsp; These sonnets, in which Mr. Watts-Dunton tells the
story of the girl who lived in the Casket lighthouse, appeared in
the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; a week after Mr. Swinburne and
he returned from a visit to the Channel Islands.&nbsp; They
record a real incident.&nbsp; Some <a name="page414"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 414</span>time afterwards Mr. Swinburne
published in the &lsquo;English Illustrated Magazine&rsquo; his
version of the story, a splendid specimen of his sonorous
rhythms.</p>
<p>Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s version of the story may interest the
reader:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">LOVE BRINGS WARNING OF
NATURA MALIGNA<br />
<span class="GutSmall">(THE POET SAILING WITH A FRIEND PAST THE
CASKET LIGHTHOUSE)</span></p>
<p>Amid the Channel&rsquo;s wiles and deep decoys,<br />
Where yonder Beacons watch the siren-sea,<br />
A girl was reared who knew nor flower nor tree<br />
Nor breath of grass at dawn, yet had high joys:<br />
The moving lawns whose verdure never cloys<br />
Were hers.&nbsp; At last she sailed to Alderney,<br />
But there she pined.&nbsp; &lsquo;The bustling world,&rsquo; said
she,<br />
&lsquo;Is all too full of trouble, full of noise.&rsquo;<br />
The storm-child, fainting for her home, the storm,<br />
Had winds for sponsor&mdash;one proud rock for nurse,<br />
Whose granite arms, through countless years, disperse<br />
All billowy squadrons tide and wind can form:<br />
The cold bright sea was hers for universe<br />
Till o&rsquo;er the waves Love flew and fanned them warm.</p>
<p>But love brings Fear with eyes of augury:&mdash;<br />
Her lover&rsquo;s boat was out; her ears were dinned<br />
With sea-sobs warning of the awakened wind<br />
That shook the troubled sun&rsquo;s red canopy.<br />
Even while she prayed the storm&rsquo;s high revelry<br />
Woke petrel, gull&mdash;all revellers winged and finned&mdash;<br
/>
And clutched a sail brown-patched and weather-thinned,<br />
And then a swimmer fought a white, wild sea.<br />
&lsquo;My songs are louder, child, than prayers of
thine,&rsquo;<br />
The Mother sang.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thy sea-boy waged no strife<br />
With Hatred&rsquo;s poison, gangrened Envy&rsquo;s
knife&mdash;<br />
With me he strove, in deadly sport divine,<br />
Who lend to men, to gods, an hour of life,<br />
Then give them sleep within these arms of mine!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page415"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 415</span>Two
poems more absolutely unlike could not be found in our literature
than these poems on the same subject by two intimate
friends.&nbsp; It seems impossible that the two writers could
ever have read each other&rsquo;s work or ever have known each
other well.&nbsp; The point which I wish to emphasize is that two
poets or two literary men may be more intimate than brothers,
they may live with each other constantly, they may meet each
other every day, at luncheon, at dinner, they may spend a large
portion of the evening in each other&rsquo;s society; and yet
when they sit down at their desks they may be as far asunder as
the poles.&nbsp; From this we may perhaps infer that among the
many imaginable divisions of writers there is this one: there are
men who can collaborate and men who cannot.</p>
<p>Many well-known writers have expressed their admiration of
this poem.&nbsp; I may mention that the other day I came across a
little book called &lsquo;Authors that have Influenced me,&rsquo;
and found that Mr. Rider Haggard instanced the opening section of
&lsquo;The Coming of Love,&rsquo; &lsquo;Mother Carey&rsquo;s
Chicken,&rsquo; as being the piece of writing that had influenced
him more than all others.&nbsp; I think this is a compliment, for
the originality of invention displayed in &lsquo;King
Solomon&rsquo;s Mines&rsquo; and &lsquo;She&rsquo; sets Rider
Haggard apart among the story-tellers of our time, and I agree
with Mr. Andrew Lang in thinking that the invention of a story
that is new and also good is a rare achievement.</p>
<p>I can find no space to give as much attention as I should like
to give to Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s miscellaneous sonnets.&nbsp;
Some of them have had a great vogue: for instance, &lsquo;John
the Pilgrim.&rsquo;&nbsp; Like all Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s
sonnets, it lends itself to illustration, and Mr. Arthur Hacker,
A.R.A., as will be seen, has done <a name="page416"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 416</span>full justice to the imaginative
strength of the subject.&nbsp; It is no exaggeration to say that
there is a simple grandeur in this design which Mr. Hacker has
seldom reached elsewhere, the sinister power of Natura Benigna
being symbolized by the desert waste and nature&rsquo;s mockery
by the mirage:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Beneath the sand-storm John the Pilgrim prays;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; But when he rises, lo! an Eden smiles,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Green leafy slopes, meadows of chamomiles,<br />
Claspt in a silvery river&rsquo;s winding maze:<br />
&lsquo;Water, water!&nbsp; Blessed be God!&rsquo; he says,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And totters gasping toward those happy isles.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then all is fled!&nbsp; Over the sandy piles<br />
The bald-eyed vultures come and stand at gaze.</p>
<p>&lsquo;God heard me not,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;blessed be
God!&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And dies.&nbsp; But as he nears the pearly
strand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s outer coast where waiting
angels stand,<br />
He looks below: &lsquo;Farewell, thou hooded clod,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Brown corpse the vultures tear on bloody sand:<br />
God heard my prayer for life&mdash;blessed be God!&rsquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>This sonnet is a miracle of verbal parsimony: it has been
called an epic in fourteen lines, yet its brevity does not make
it obscure, or gnarled, or affected; and the motive adumbrates
the whole history of religious faith from Job to Jesus Christ,
from Moses to Mahomet.&nbsp; The rhymes in this sonnet illustrate
my own theory as to the rhymer&rsquo;s luck, good and ill.&nbsp;
To have written this little epic upon four rhymes would not have
been possible, even for Mr. Watts-Dunton, had it not been for the
luck of &lsquo;chamomiles&rsquo; and &lsquo;isles,&rsquo;
&lsquo;chamomiles&rsquo; giving the picture of the flowers, and
&lsquo;isles&rsquo; giving the false vision of the mirage.&nbsp;
The same thing is notable in the case of another amazing tour de
force, &lsquo;The Bedouin Child&rsquo; (see p. 448), where the <a
name="page417"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 417</span>same verbal
parsimony is exemplified.&nbsp; Without the fortunate rhyme-words
&lsquo;pashas,&rsquo; &lsquo;camel-maws,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;claws&rsquo; in the octave, the picture could not have
been given in less than a dozen lines.</p>
<p>The kinship between Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s poetry and that
of Coleridge has been frequently discussed.&nbsp; It has the same
romantic glamour and often the same music, as far as the music of
decasyllabic lines can call up the music of the ravishing
octosyllabics of &lsquo;Christabel.&rsquo;&nbsp; This at least I
know, from his critical remarks on Coleridge,&mdash;he owns the
true wizard of romance as master.&nbsp; I do not think that any
one of his sonnets affords me quite the unmixed delight which I
find in the sonnet on Coleridge, and his friend George Meredith
is here in accord with me, for he wrote to the author as follows:
&lsquo;The sonnet is pure amber for a piece of descriptive
analogy that fits the poet wonderfully, and one might beat about
through volumes of essays and not so paint him.&nbsp; There is
Coleridge!&nbsp; But whence the source of your story&mdash;if
anything of such aptness could have been other than dreamed after
a draught of Xanadu&mdash;I cannot tell.&nbsp; It is new to
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After that flash of critical divination, it is fitting to
present the reader with the &lsquo;pure amber&rsquo;
itself:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>I see thee pine like her in golden story<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who, in her prison, woke and saw, one day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The gates thrown open&mdash;saw the sunbeams
play,<br />
With only a web &rsquo;tween her and summer&rsquo;s glory;<br />
Who, when that web&mdash;so frail, so transitory,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It broke before her breath&mdash;had fallen away,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Saw other webs and others rise for aye<br />
Which kept her prisoned till her hair was hoary.</p>
<p>Those songs half-sung that yet were all divine&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That woke Romance, the queen, to reign
afresh&mdash;<br />
<a name="page418"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 418</span>Had been
but preludes from that lyre of thine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Could thy rare spirit&rsquo;s wings have pierced the
mesh<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Spun by the wizard who compels the flesh,<br />
But lets the poet see how heav&rsquo;n can shine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here again the verbal parsimony is notable.&nbsp; I defy any
one to find anything like it except in Dante, the great master of
verbal parsimony.&nbsp; There are only six adjectives in the
whole sonnet.&nbsp; Every word is cunningly chosen, not for
ornament, but solely for clarity of meaning.&nbsp; The metrical
structure is subtly moulded so as to suspend the rising imagery
until the last word of the octave, and then to let it glide, as a
sunbeam glides down the air, to its lovely dying fall.&nbsp;
Metrical students will delight in the double rhymes of the
octave, which play so great a part in the suspensive music.</p>
<p>I have frequently thought that one of the most daring things,
as well as one of the wisest, done by the editor of the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um,&rsquo; was that of printing Rhona&rsquo;s
letters, bristling with Romany words, with a glossary at the foot
of the page, and printing them without any of the context of the
poem to shed light upon it and upon Rhona.&nbsp; It certainly
showed immense confidence in his contributor to do that; and yet
the poems were a great success.&nbsp; The best thing said about
Rhona has been said by Mr. George Meredith: &ldquo;I am in love
with Rhona, not the only one in that.&nbsp; When I read her
love-letter in the &lsquo;Athen&aelig;um,&rsquo; I had the regret
that the dialect might cause its banishment from
literature.&nbsp; Reading the whole poem through, I see that it
is as good as salt to a palate.&nbsp; We are the richer for it,
and that is a rare thing to say of any poem now
printed.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, discussing &lsquo;The Coming of
Love,&rsquo; Meredith wrote: &lsquo;I will not speak of the tours
de <a name="page419"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 419</span>force
except to express a bit of astonishment at the dexterity which
can perform them without immolating the tender spirit of the
work.&rsquo;&nbsp; Indeed, the technical mastery of Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s poetry is so consummate that it is concealed
from the reader.&nbsp; There is no sense of difficulty overcome,
no parade of artifice.&nbsp; Yet the metrical structure of the
very poem which seems the simplest is actually the
subtlest.&nbsp; &lsquo;Rhona&rsquo;s Love Letter&rsquo; is
written in an extremely complex rhyme-pattern, each stanza of
eight lines being built on two rhymes, like the octave of a
sonnet.&nbsp; But so cunningly are the Romany words woven into a
na&iuml;ve, unconscious charm that the reader forgets the
rhyme-scheme altogether, and does not realize that this
spontaneous sweetness and bubbling humour are produced by the
most elaborate art.</p>
<p>I have emphasized the originality of Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s
poetry.&nbsp; There can be no doubt that he is the most original
poet since Coleridge, not merely in verbal, metrical, and
rhythmical idiosyncrasy, but in the deeper quality of imaginative
energy.&nbsp; By &lsquo;the most original poet&rsquo; I do not
mean the greatest poet: the student of poetry will know at once
what I mean.&nbsp; Poe&rsquo;s &lsquo;Raven&rsquo; is more
&lsquo;original&rsquo; than Shelley&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Epipsychidion,&rsquo; but it is not so great.&nbsp; In my
article on Blake in Chambers&rsquo;s &lsquo;Cyclop&aelig;dia of
English Literature,&rsquo; I pointed out that there are greater
poets than Blake (or Donne) but none more original.&nbsp; There
are many poets who possess that ordinary kind of imagination
which is mainly a perpetual matching of common ideas with common
metaphors.&nbsp; But few poets have the rarer kind of imagination
which creates not only the metaphor but also the idea, and then
fuses both into one piece of beauty.&nbsp; Now Mr. Watts-Dunton
has this <a name="page420"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
420</span>supreme gift.&nbsp; He uses the symbol to suggest ideas
which cannot be suggested otherwise.&nbsp; His theory of the
universe is optimistic, but his optimism is interwoven with
sombre threads.&nbsp; He sees the dualism of Nature, and he shows
her alternately as malignant and as benignant.&nbsp; Indeed, he
has concentrated his spiritual cosmogony into the two great
sonnets, &lsquo;Natura Maligna&rsquo; and &lsquo;Natura
Benigna,&rsquo; which I have already quoted.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>All the critics were delighted with the humour of Rhona
Boswell.&nbsp; Upon this subject Mr. Watts-Dunton makes some
pregnant remarks in the introduction to the later editions of the
poem:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But it is with regard to the humour of
gypsy women that Gorgio readers seem to be most sceptical.&nbsp;
The humourous endowment of most races is found to be more
abundant and richer in quality among the men than among the
women.&nbsp; But among the Romanies the women seem to have taken
humour with the rest of the higher qualities.</p>
<p>A question that has been most frequently asked me in
connection with my two gypsy heroines has been: Have gypsy girls
really the esprit and the humourous charm that you attribute to
them?&nbsp; My answer to this question shall be a quotation from
Mr. Groome&rsquo;s delightful book, &lsquo;Gypsy
Folk-Tales.&rsquo;&nbsp; Speaking of the Romany chi&rsquo;s
incomparable piquancy, he says:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have known a gypsy girl dash off what was almost a
folk-tale impromptu.&nbsp; She had been to a pic-nic in a
four-in-hand with &ldquo;a lot o&rsquo; real tip-top
gentry&rdquo;; and &ldquo;Reia,&rdquo; she said to me afterwards,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you the comicalest thing as ever
was.&nbsp; We&rsquo;d pulled up to put the brake on, and there
was a p&uacute;ro hotchiwitchi (old hedge-hog) <a
name="page421"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 421</span>come and
looked at us through the hedge; looked at me hard.&nbsp; I could
see he&rsquo;d his eye upon me.&nbsp; And home he&rsquo;d go,
that old hedgehog, to his wife, and &lsquo;Missus,&rsquo;
he&rsquo;d say, &lsquo;what d&rsquo;ye think?&nbsp; I seen a
little gypsy gal just now in a coach and four horses&rsquo;; and
&lsquo;Dabla,&rsquo; she&rsquo;d say, &lsquo;sawkumni &rsquo;as
varde kenaw&rsquo;&rdquo; [&lsquo;Bless us! every one now keeps a
carriage&rsquo;].&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now, without saying that this impromptu folklorist was Rhona
Boswell, I will at least aver, without fear of contradiction from
Mr. Groome, that it might well have been she.&nbsp; Although
there is as great a difference between one Romany chi and another
as between one English girl and another, there is a strange and
fascinating kinship between the humour of all gypsy girls.&nbsp;
No three girls could possibly be more unlike than Sinfi Lovell,
Rhona Boswell, and the girl of whom Mr. Groome gives his
anecdote; and yet there is a similarity between the fanciful
humour of them all.&nbsp; The humour of Rhona Boswell must speak
for itself in these pages&mdash;where, however, the passionate
and tragic side of her character and her story dominates
everything.&rdquo;</p>

422</span>Chapter XXVII<br />
&ldquo;CHRISTMAS AT THE &lsquo;MERMAID&rsquo;&rdquo;</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Second</span> in importance to &lsquo;The
Coming of Love&rsquo; among Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s poems is the
poem I have already mentioned&mdash;the poem which Mr. Swinburne
has described as &lsquo;a great lyrical
epic&rsquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Christmas at the
&lsquo;Mermaid.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; The originality of this
wonderful poem is quite as striking as that of &lsquo;The Coming
of Love.&rsquo;&nbsp; No other writer would have dreamed of
depicting the doomed Armada as being led to destruction by a
golden skeleton in the form of one of the burnt Incas, called up
by &lsquo;the righteous sea,&rsquo; and squatting grimly at the
prow of Medina&rsquo;s flag-ship.&nbsp; Here we get &lsquo;The
Renascence of Wonder&rsquo; indeed.&nbsp; Some Aylwinians put it
at the head of all his writings.&nbsp; The exploit of David Gwynn
is accepted by Motley and others as historic, but it needed the
co-operation of the Golden Skeleton to lift his narrative into
the highest heaven of poetry.&nbsp; Extremely unlike &lsquo;The
Coming of Love&rsquo; as it is in construction, it is built on
the same metrical scheme; and it illustrates equally well with
&lsquo;The Coming of Love&rsquo; the remarks I have made upon a
desideratum in poetic art&mdash;that is to say, it is cast in a
form which gives as much scope to the dramatic instinct at work
as is given by a play, and yet it is a form free from the
restrictions by which a play must necessarily be cramped.&nbsp;
The poem was written, or mainly written, during one of those
visits <a name="page423"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
423</span>which, as I have already said, Mr. Watts-Dunton used to
pay to Stratford-on-Avon.&nbsp; The scene is laid, however, in
London, at that famous &lsquo;Mermaid&rsquo; tavern which haunts
the dreams of all English poets:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;With the exception of Shakespeare, who has
quitted London for good, in order to reside at New Place,
Stratford-on-Avon, which he has lately rebuilt, all the members
of the &lsquo;Mermaid&rsquo; Club are assembled at the
&lsquo;Mermaid&rsquo; Tavern.&nbsp; At the head of the table sits
Ben Jonson dealing out wassail from a large bowl.&nbsp; At the
other end sits Raleigh, and at Raleigh&rsquo;s right hand, the
guest he had brought with him, a stranger, David Gwynn, the Welsh
seaman, now an elderly man, whose story of his exploits as a
galley-slave in crippling the Armada before it reached the
Channel had, years before, whether true or false, given him in
the low countries a great reputation, the echo of which had
reached England.&nbsp; Raleigh&rsquo;s desire was to excite the
public enthusiasm for continuing the struggle with Spain on the
sea, and generally to revive the fine Elizabethan temper, which
had already become almost a thing of the past, save, perhaps,
among such choice spirits as those associated with the
&lsquo;Mermaid&rsquo; club.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It opens with a chorus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Christmas knows a merry, merry place,<br />
Where he goes with fondest face,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Brightest eye, brightest hair:<br />
Tell the Mermaid where is that one place:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Ben Jonson rises, fills the cup with wassail and drinks
to Shakespeare, and thus comments upon his absence:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page424"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
424</span>That he, the star of revel, bright-eyed Will,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With life at golden summit, fled the town<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And took from Thames that light to dwindle down<br
/>
O&rsquo;er Stratford farms, doth make me marvel still.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then he calls upon Shakespeare&rsquo;s most intimate
friend&mdash;the mysterious Mr. W. H. of the sonnets&mdash;to
give them reminiscences of Shakespeare with a special reference
to the memorable evening when he arrived at Stratford on quitting
London for good and all.</p>
<p>To the sixth edition of the poem Mr. Watts-Dunton prefixed the
following remarks, and I give them here because they throw light
upon his view of Shakespeare&rsquo;s friend:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Since the appearance of this volume, there
has been a great deal of acute and learned discussion as to the
identity of that mysterious &lsquo;friend&rsquo; of Shakespeare,
to whom so many of the sonnets are addressed.&nbsp; But
everything that has been said upon the subject seems to fortify
me in the opinion that &lsquo;no critic has been able to
identify&rsquo; that friend.&nbsp; Southampton seems at first to
fit into the sacred place; so does Pembroke at first.&nbsp; But,
after a while, true and unbiassed criticism rejects them
both.&nbsp; I therefore feel more than ever justified in
&lsquo;imagining the friend for myself.&rsquo;&nbsp; And this, at
least, I know, that to have been the friend of Shakespeare, a man
must needs have been a lover of nature;&mdash;he must have been a
lover of England, too.&nbsp; And upon these two points, and upon
another&mdash;the movement of a soul dominated by friendship as a
passion&mdash;I have tried to show Shakespeare&rsquo;s probable
influence upon his &lsquo;friend of friends.&rsquo;&nbsp; It
would have been a mistake, however, to cast the sonnets in the
same metrical mould as Shakespeare&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page425"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
425</span>Shakspeare&rsquo;s friend thus records what Shakespeare
had told him about his return to Stratford:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>As down the bank he strolled through evening
dew,<br />
Pictures (he told me) of remembered eves<br />
Mixt with that dream the Avon ever weaves,<br />
And all his happy childhood came to view;<br />
He saw a child watching the birds that flew<br />
Above a willow, through whose musky leaves<br />
A green musk-beetle shone with mail and greaves<br />
That shifted in the light to bronze and blue.<br />
These dreams, said he, were born of fragrance falling<br />
From trees he loved, the scent of musk recalling,<br />
With power beyond all power of things beholden<br />
Or things reheard, those days when elves of dusk<br />
Came, veiled the wings of evening feathered golden,<br />
And closed him in from all but willow musk.</p>
<p>And then a child beneath a silver sallow&mdash;<br />
A child who loved the swans, the moorhen&rsquo;s
&lsquo;cheep&rsquo;&mdash;<br />
Angled for bream where river holes were deep&mdash;<br />
For gudgeon where the water glittered shallow,<br />
Or ate the &lsquo;fairy cheeses&rsquo; of the mallow,<br />
And wild fruits gathered where the wavelets creep<br />
Round that loved church whose shadow seems to sleep<br />
In love upon the stream and bless and hallow;<br />
And then a child to whom the water-fairies<br />
Sent fish to &lsquo;bite&rsquo; from Avon&rsquo;s holes and
shelves,<br />
A child to whom, from richest honey-dairies,<br />
The flower-sprites sent the bees and &lsquo;sunshine
elves&rsquo;;<br />
Then, in the shifting vision&rsquo;s sweet vagaries,<br />
He saw two lovers walking by themselves&mdash;</p>
<p>Walking beneath the trees, where drops of rain<br />
Wove crowns of sunlit opal to decoy<br />
Young love from home; and one, the happy boy,<br />
Knew all the thoughts of birds in every strain&mdash;<br />
Knew why the cushat breaks his fond refrain<br />
By sudden silence, &lsquo;lest his plaint should
cloy&rsquo;&mdash;<br />
Knew when the skylark&rsquo;s changing note of joy<br />
<a name="page426"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 426</span>Saith,
&lsquo;Now will I return to earth again&rsquo;&mdash;<br />
Knew every warning of the blackbird&rsquo;s shriek,<br />
And every promise of his joyful song&mdash;<br />
Knew what the magpie&rsquo;s chuckle fain would speak;<br />
And, when a silent cuckoo flew along,<br />
Bearing an egg in her felonious beak,<br />
Knew every nest threatened with grievous wrong.<br />
He heard her say, &lsquo;The birds attest our troth!&rsquo;<br />
Hark to the mavis, Will, in yonder may<br />
Fringing the sward, where many a hawthorn spray<br />
Round summer&rsquo;s royal field of golden cloth<br />
Shines o&rsquo;er the buttercups like snowy froth,<br />
And that sweet skylark on his azure way,<br />
And that wise cuckoo, hark to what they say:<br />
&lsquo;We birds of Avon heard and bless you both.&rsquo;<br />
And, Will, the sunrise, flushing with its glory,<br />
River and church, grows rosier with our story!<br />
This breeze of morn, sweetheart, which moves caressing,<br />
Hath told the flowers; they wake to lovelier growth!<br />
They breathe&mdash;o&rsquo;er mead and stream they
breathe&mdash;the blessing.<br />
&lsquo;We flowers of Avon heard and bless you both!&rsquo;</p>

<p>When Mr. &lsquo;W. H.&rsquo; sits down, the friend and brother
of another great poet, Christopher Marlowe, who had been sitting
moody and silent, oppressed by thoughts of the dead man, many of
whose unfriends were at the gathering, recites these lines
&lsquo;On Seeing Kit Marlowe Slain at Deptford&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&rsquo;Tis Marlowe falls!&nbsp; That last lunge
rent asunder<br />
Our lyre of spirit and flesh, Kit Marlowe&rsquo;s life,<br />
Whose chords seemed strung by earth and heaven at strife,<br />
Yet ever strung to beauty above or under!<br />
Heav&rsquo;n kens of Man, but oh! the stars can blunder,<br />
If Fate&rsquo;s hand guided yonder villain&rsquo;s knife<br />
Through that rare brain, so teeming, daring, rife<br />
With dower of poets&mdash;song and love and wonder.<br />
Or was it Chance?&nbsp; Shakspeare, who art supreme<br />
O&rsquo;er man and men, yet sharest Marlowe&rsquo;s sight<br />
<a name="page427"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 427</span>To
pierce the clouds that hide the inhuman height<br />
Where man and men and gods and all that seem<br />
Are Nature&rsquo;s mutterings in her changeful dream&mdash;<br />
Come, spell the runes these bloody rivulets write!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After they have all drunk in silence to the memory of Marlowe,
Marlowe&rsquo;s friend speaks:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Where&rsquo;er thou art, &lsquo;dead
Shepherd,&rsquo; look on me;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy who loved thee loves more dearly now,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He sees thine eyes in yonder holly-bough;<br />
Oh, Kit, my Kit, the Mermaid drinks to thee!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Raleigh rises, and the great business of the evening
begins with the following splendid chorus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span

</blockquote>
<p>Upon being thus called forth the old sea-dog rises, and tells
a wonderful story indeed, the &lsquo;story of how he and the
Golden Skeleton crippled the Great Armada sailing
out&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;A galley lie&rsquo; they called my tale;
but he<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose talk is with the deep kens mighty tales:<br />
The man, I say, who helped to keep you free<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="page429"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
429</span>Stands here, a truthful son of truthful Wales.<br />
Slandered by England as a loose-lipped liar,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Banished from Ireland, branded rogue and thief,<br
/>
Here stands that Gwynn whose life of torments dire<br />
Heaven sealed for England, sealed in blood and fire&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Stands asking here Truth&rsquo;s one reward,
belief!</p>
<p>And Spain shall tell, with pallid lips of dread,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This tale of mine&mdash;shall tell, in future
days,<br />
How Gwynn, the galley-slave, once fought and bled<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For England when she moved in perilous ways;<br />
But say, ye gentlemen of England, sprung<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From loins of men whose ghosts have still the
sea&mdash;<br />
Doth England&mdash;she who loves the loudest tongue&mdash;<br />
Remember mariners whose deeds are sung<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By waves where flowed their blood to keep her
free?</p>
<p>I see&mdash;I see ev&rsquo;n now&mdash;those ships of Spain<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Gathered in Tagus&rsquo; mouth to make the
spring;<br />
I feel the cursed oar, I toil again,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And trumpets blare, and priests and choir-boys
sing;<br />
And morning strikes with many a crimson shaft,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through ruddy haze, four galleys rowing
out&mdash;<br />
Four galleys built to pierce the English craft,<br />
Each swivel-gunned for raking fore and aft,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Snouted like sword-fish, but with iron snout.</p>
<p>And one we call the &lsquo;Princess,&rsquo; one the
&lsquo;Royal,&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Diana&rsquo; one; but &rsquo;tis the
fell &lsquo;Basana&rsquo;<br />
Where I am toiling, Gwynn, the true, the loyal,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thinking of mighty Drake and Gloriana;<br />
For by their help Hope whispers me that I&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whom ten hours&rsquo; daily travail at a stretch<br
/>
Has taught how sweet a thing it is to die&mdash;<br />
May strike once more where flags of England fly,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Strike for myself and many a haggard wretch.</p>
<p>True sorrow knows a tale it may not tell:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Again I feel the lash that tears my back;<br />
Again I hear mine own blaspheming yell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Answered by boatswain&rsquo;s laugh and
scourge&rsquo;s crack;<br />
Again I feel the pang when trying to choke<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="page430"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
430</span>Rather than drink the wine, or chew the bread<br />
Wherewith, when rest for meals would break the stroke,<br />
They cram our mouths while still we sit at yoke;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Again is Life, not Death, the shape of dread.</p>
<p>By Finisterre there comes a sudden gale,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And mighty waves assault our trembling galley<br />
With blows that strike her waist as strikes a flail,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And soldiers cry, &lsquo;What saint shall bid her
rally?&rsquo;<br />
Some slaves refuse to row, and some implore<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Dons to free them from the metal tether<br />
By which their limbs are locked upon the oar;<br />
Some shout, in answer to the billows&rsquo; roar,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;The Dons and we will drink brine-wine
together.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bring up the slave,&rsquo; I hear the captain cry,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Who sank the golden galleon &ldquo;El
Dorado,&rdquo;<br />
The dog can steer.&rsquo;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Here sits the dog,&rsquo; quoth I,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Who sank the ship of Commodore
Medrado!&rsquo;<br />
With hell-lit eyes, blistered by spray and rain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing upon the bridge, saith he to me:<br />
&lsquo;Hearken, thou pirate&mdash;bold Medrado&rsquo;s
bane!&mdash;<br />
Freedom and gold are thine, and thanks of Spain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If thou canst take the galley through this
sea.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay! ay!&rsquo; quoth I.&nbsp; The fools unlock me
straight!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And then &rsquo;tis I give orders to the Don,<br />
Laughing within to hear the laugh of Fate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose winning game I know hath just begun.<br />
I mount the bridge when dies the last red streak<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of evening, and the moon seems fain for night<br />
Oh then I see beneath the galley&rsquo;s beak<br />
A glow like Spanish <i>auto&rsquo;s</i> ruddy reek&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh then these eyes behold a wondrous sight!</p>
<p>A skeleton, but yet with living eyes&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A skeleton, but yet with bones like gold&mdash;<br
/>
Squats on the galley-beak, in wondrous wise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And round his brow, of high imperial mould,<br />
A burning circle seems to shake and shine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="page431"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
431</span>Bright, fiery bright, with many a living gem,<br />
Throwing a radiance o&rsquo;er the foam-lit brine:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis God&rsquo;s Revenge,&rsquo;
methinks.&nbsp; &lsquo;Heaven sends for sign<br />
That bony shape&mdash;that Inca&rsquo;s diadem.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At first the sign is only seen of me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But well I know that God&rsquo;s Revenge hath
come<br />
To strike the Armada, set old ocean free,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And cleanse from stain of Spain the beauteous
foam.<br />
Quoth I, &lsquo;How fierce soever be the levin<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Spain&rsquo;s hand can hurl&mdash;made mightier
still for wrong<br />
By that great Scarlet One whose hills are seven&mdash;<br />
Yea, howsoever Hell may scoff at Heaven&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Stronger than Hell is God, though Hell is
strong.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The dog can steer,&rsquo; I laugh; &lsquo;yea,
Drake&rsquo;s men know<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How sea-dogs hold a ship to Biscay waves.&rsquo;<br
/>
Ah! when I bid the soldiers go below,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some &rsquo;neath the hatches, some beside the
slaves,<br />
And bid them stack their muskets all in piles<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beside the foremast, covered by a sail,<br />
The captives guess my plan&mdash;I see their smiles<br />
As down the waist the cozened troop defiles,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Staggering and stumbling landsmen, faint and
pale.</p>
<p>I say, they guess my plan&mdash;to send beneath<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The soldiers to the benches where the slaves<br />
Sit, armed with eager nails and eager teeth&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hate&rsquo;s nails and teeth more keen than Spanish
glaives,<br />
Then wait until the tempest&rsquo;s waxing might<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall reach its fiercest, mingling sea and sky,<br
/>
Then seize the key, unlock the slaves, and smite<br />
The sea-sick soldiers in their helpless plight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then bid the Spaniards pull at oar or die.</p>
<p>Past Ferrol Bay each galley &rsquo;gins to stoop,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shuddering before the Biscay demon&rsquo;s
breath.<br />
Down goes a prow&mdash;down goes a gaudy poop:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;The Don&rsquo;s &ldquo;Diana&rdquo;
bears the Don to death,&rsquo;<br />
Quoth I, &lsquo;and see the &ldquo;Princess&rdquo; plunge and
wallow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Down purple trough, o&rsquo;er snowy crest of
foam:<br />
<a name="page432"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 432</span>See!
see! the &ldquo;Royal,&rdquo; how she tries to follow<br />
By many a glimmering crest and shimmering hollow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where gull and petrel scarcely dare to
roam.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now, three queen-galleys pass Cape Finisterre;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Armada, dreaming but of ocean-storms,<br />
Thinks not of mutineers with shoulders bare,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Chained, bloody-wealed and pale, on galley-forms,<br
/>
Each rower murmuring o&rsquo;er my whispered plan,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Deep-burnt within his brain in words of fire,<br />
&lsquo;Rise, every man, to tear to death his man&mdash;<br />
Yea, tear as only galley-captives can,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When God&rsquo;s Revenge sings loud to ocean&rsquo;s
lyre.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Taller the spectre grows &rsquo;mid ocean&rsquo;s din;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The captain sees the Skeleton and pales:<br />
I give the sign: the slaves cry, &lsquo;Ho for Gwynn!&rsquo;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Teach them,&rsquo; quoth I, &lsquo;the
way we grip in Wales.&rsquo;<br />
And, leaping down where hateful boatswains shake,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I win the key&mdash;let loose a storm of slaves:<br
/>
&lsquo;When captives hold the whip, let drivers quake,&rsquo;<br
/>
They cry; &lsquo;sit down, ye Dons, and row for Drake,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or drink to England&rsquo;s Queen in foaming
waves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We leap adown the hatches; in the dark<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We stab the Dons at random, till I see<br />
A spark that trembles like a tinder-spark,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Waxing and brightening, till it seems to be<br />
A fleshless skull, with eyes of joyful fire:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, lo: a bony shape with lifted hands&mdash;<br
/>
A bony mouth that chants an anthem dire,<br />
O&rsquo;ertopping groans, o&rsquo;ertopping Ocean&rsquo;s
quire&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A skeleton with Inca&rsquo;s diadem stands!</p>
<p>It sings the song I heard an Indian sing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Chained by the ruthless Dons to burn at stake,<br />
When priests of Tophet chanted in a ring,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sniffing man&rsquo;s flesh at roast for Christ His
sake.<br />
The Spaniards hear: they see: they fight no more;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They cross their foreheads, but they dare not
speak.<br />
Anon the spectre, when the strife is o&rsquo;er,<br />
<a name="page433"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 433</span>Melts
from the dark, then glimmers as before,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Burning upon the conquered galley&rsquo;s beak.</p>
<p>And now the moon breaks through the night, and shows<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The &lsquo;Royal&rsquo; bearing down upon our
craft&mdash;<br />
Then comes a broadside close at hand, which strows<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our deck with bleeding bodies fore and aft.<br />
I take the helm; I put the galley near:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We grapple in silver sheen of moonlit surge.<br />
Amid the &lsquo;Royal&rsquo;s&rsquo; din I laugh to hear<br />
The curse of many a British mutineer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The crack, crack, crack of boatswain&rsquo;s biting
scourge.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ye scourge in vain,&rsquo; quoth I, &lsquo;scourging
for life<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Slaves who shall row no more to save the
Don&rsquo;;<br />
For from the &lsquo;Royal&rsquo;s&rsquo; poop, above the
strife,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their captain gazes at our Skeleton!<br />
&lsquo;What! is it thou, Pirate of &ldquo;El Dorado&rdquo;?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He shouts in English tongue.&nbsp; And there,
behold!<br />
Stands he, the devil&rsquo;s commodore, Medrado.<br />
&lsquo;Ay! ay!&rsquo; quoth I, &lsquo;Spain owes me one
strappado<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For scuttling Philip&rsquo;s ship of stolen
gold.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I come for that strappado now,&rsquo; quoth I.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;What means yon thing of burning
bones?&rsquo; he saith.<br />
&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis God&rsquo;s Revenge cries, &ldquo;Bloody Spain
shall die!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The king of El Dorado&rsquo;s name is Death.<br />
Strike home, ye slaves; your hour is coming swift,&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I cry; &lsquo;strong hands are stretched to save you
now;<br />
Show yonder spectre you are worth the gift.&rsquo;<br />
But when the &lsquo;Royal,&rsquo; captured, rides adrift,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I look: the skeleton hath left our prow.</p>
<p>When all are slain, the tempest&rsquo;s wings have fled,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But still the sea is dreaming of the storm:<br />
Far down the offing glows a spot of red,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My soul knows well it hath that Inca&rsquo;s
form.<br />
&lsquo;It lights,&rsquo; quoth I, &lsquo;the red cross banner of
Spain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There on the flagship where Medina sleeps&mdash;<br
/>
Hell&rsquo;s banner, wet with sweat of Indian&rsquo;s pain,<br />
And tears of women yoked to treasure train,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Scarlet of blood for which the New World
weeps.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page434"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 434</span>There
on the dark the flagship of the Don<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To me seems luminous of the spectre&rsquo;s glow;<br
/>
But soon an arc of gold, and then the sun,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rise o&rsquo;er the reddening billows, proud and
slow;<br />
Then, through the curtains of the morning mist,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That take all shifting colours as they shake,<br />
I see the great Armada coil and twist<br />
Miles, miles along the ocean&rsquo;s amethyst,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like hell&rsquo;s old snake of hate&mdash;the winged
snake.</p>
<p>And, when the hazy veils of Morn are thinned,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That snake accursed, with wings which swell and
puff<br />
Before the slackening horses of the wind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Turns into shining ships that tack and luff.<br />
&lsquo;Behold,&rsquo; quoth I, &lsquo;their floating citadels,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The same the priests have vouched for
musket-proof,<br />
Caracks and hulks and nimble caravels,<br />
That sailed with us to sound of Lisbon bells&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea, sailed from Tagus&rsquo; mouth, for
Christ&rsquo;s behoof.</p>
<p>For Christ&rsquo;s behoof they sailed: see how they go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With that red skeleton to show the way<br />
There sitting on Medina&rsquo;s stem aglow&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A hundred sail and forty-nine, men say;<br />
Behold them, brothers, galleon and galeasse&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their dizened turrets bright of many a plume,<br />
Their gilded poops, their shining guns of brass,<br />
Their trucks, their flags&mdash;behold them, how they
pass&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With God&rsquo;s Revenge for figurehead&mdash;to
Doom!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Ben Jonson, the symposiarch, rises and calls upon Raleigh
to tell the story of the defeat of the Great Armada.&nbsp; I can
give only a stanza or two and the chorus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Raleigh</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The choirboys sing the matin song,<br />
When down falls Seymour on the Spaniard&rsquo;s right.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He drives the wing&mdash;a huddled throng&mdash;<br
/>
Back on the centre ships, that steer for flight.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="page435"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
435</span>While galleon hurtles galeasse,<br />
And oars that fight each other kill the slaves,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As scythes cut down the summer grass,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Drake closes on the writhing mass,<br />
Through which the balls at closest ranges pass,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Skimming the waves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiercely do galley and galeasse fight,<br />
Running from ship to ship like living things.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With oars like legs, with beaks that smite,<br />
Winged centipedes they seem with tattered wings.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through smoke we see their chiefs encased<br />
In shining mail of gold where blood congeals;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And once I see within a waist<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wild English captives ashen-faced,<br />
Their bending backs by Spanish scourges laced<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In purple weals.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">[<span class="smcap">David
Gwynn</span> here leaps up, pale and panting, and<br />
bares a scarred arm, but at a sign from <span
class="smcap">Raleigh</span><br />
sits down again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Don fights well, but fights not now<br
/>
The cozened Indian whom he kissed for friend,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To pluck the gold from off the brow,<br />
Then fling the flesh to priests to burn and rend.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He hunts not now the Indian maid<br />
With bloodhound&rsquo;s bay&mdash;Peru&rsquo;s confiding
daughter,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who saw in flowery bower or glade<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The stranger&rsquo;s god-like cavalcade,<br />
And worshipped, while he planned Pizarro&rsquo;s trade<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of rape and slaughter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His fight is now with Drake and Wynter,<br
/>
Hawkins, and Frobisher, and English fire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bullet and cannon ball and splinter,<br />
Till every deck gleams, greased with bloody mire:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Heaven smiles to see that battle wage,<br />
Close battle of musket, carabine, and gun:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, vainly doth the Spaniard rage<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like any wolf that tears his cage!<br />
&rsquo;Tis English sails shall win the weather gauge<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Or slaughter-pens where swine or beeves are pinned,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lee-scuppers pour a crimson flood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Reddening the waves for many a rood,<br />
As eastward, eastward still the galleons scud<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Before the wind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The chief leit-motiv of the poem is the metrical idea that
whenever a stanza ends with the word &lsquo;sea,&rsquo; Ben
Jonson and the rest of the jolly companions break into this
superb chorus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
sea!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus did England fight;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And shall not England smite<br />
With Drake&rsquo;s strong stroke in battles yet to be?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And while the winds have power<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall England lose the dower<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She won in that great hour&mdash;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The sea?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Raleigh leaves off his narrative at the point when the Armada
is driven out to the open sea.&nbsp; He sits down, and Gwynn,
worked into a frenzy of excitement, now starts up and finishes
the story in the same metre, but in quite a different
spirit.&nbsp; In Gwynn&rsquo;s fevered imagination the skeleton
which he describes in his own narrative now leads the doomed
Armada to its destruction:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Gwynn</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With towering sterns, with golden stems<br
/>
That totter in the smoke before their foe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I see them pass the mouth of Thames,<br />
With death above the billows, death below!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who leads them down the tempest&rsquo;s path,<br />
<a name="page437"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 437</span>From
Thames to Yare, from Yare to Tweedmouth blown,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Past many a Scottish hill and strath,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All helpless in the wild wind&rsquo;s wrath,<br />
Each mainmast stooping, creaking like a lath?<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Skeleton!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At length with toil the cape is passed,<br
/>
And faster and faster still the billows come<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To coil and boil till every mast<br />
Is flecked with clinging flakes of snowy foam.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I see, I see, where galleons pitch,<br />
That Inca&rsquo;s bony shape burn on the waves,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Flushing each emerald scarp and ditch,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While Mother Carey, Orkney&rsquo;s witch,<br />
Waves to the Spectre&rsquo;s song her lantern-switch<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
O&rsquo;er ocean-graves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glimmering crown of Scotland&rsquo;s
head<br />
They pass.&nbsp; No foe dares follow but the storm.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Spectre, like a sunset red,<br />
Illumines mighty Wrath&rsquo;s defiant form,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And makes the dreadful granite peak<br />
Burn o&rsquo;er the ships with brows of prophecy;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea, makes that silent countenance speak<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the tempest&rsquo;s foam and reek,<br />
More loud than all the loudest winds that shriek,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Tyrants, ye die!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Spectre, by the Orkney Isles,<br />
Writes &lsquo;God&rsquo;s Revenge&rsquo; on waves that climb and
dash,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Foaming right up the sand-built piles,<br />
Where ships are hurled.&nbsp; It sings amid the crash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea, sings amid the tempest&rsquo;s roar,<br />
Snapping of ropes, crackling of spars set free,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And yells of captives chained to oar,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And cries of those who strike for shore,<br />
&lsquo;Spain&rsquo;s murderous breath of blood shall foul no
more<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The righteous sea!&rsquo;</p>

<p>This poem, when it first appeared in the volume of &lsquo;The
Coming of Love,&rsquo; fine as it is, was overshadowed by the
wild and romantic poem which lends its name to the volume.&nbsp;
But in 1902, Mr. John Lane included it in his beautiful series,
&lsquo;Flowers of Parnassus,&rsquo; where it was charmingly
illustrated by Mr. Herbert Cole, and this widened its vogue
considerably.&nbsp; There is no doubt that for originality, for
power, and for music, &ldquo;Christmas at the
&lsquo;Mermaid&rsquo;&rdquo; is enough to form the base of any
poet&rsquo;s reputation.&nbsp; It has been enthusiastically
praised by some of the foremost writers of our time.&nbsp; I have
permission to print only one of the letters in its praise which
the author received, but that is an important one, as it comes
from Thomas Hardy, who wrote:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have been beginning Christmas, in a way,
by reading over the fire your delightful little &lsquo;Christmas
at the &ldquo;Mermaid&rdquo;&rsquo; which it was most kind of you
to send.&nbsp; I was carried back right into Armada times by
David Gwynn&rsquo;s vivid story: it seems remarkable that you
should have had the conjuring power to raise up those old years
so brightly in your own mind first, as to be able to exhibit them
to readers in such high relief of three dimensions, as one may
say.</p>
<p><a name="page441"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 441</span>The
absence of Shakespeare strikes me as being one of the finest
touches of the poem: it throws one into a &lsquo;humourous
melancholy&rsquo;&mdash;and we feel him, in some curious way,
more than if he had been there.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="page442"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
442</span>Chapter XXVIII<br />
CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Assuredly</span>,&rsquo; says Mr.
Watts-Dunton, in his essay on Thoreau, &lsquo;there is no
profession so courageous as that of the pen.&rsquo;&nbsp; Well,
in coming to the end of my task&mdash;a task which has been a
labour of love&mdash;I wish I could feel confident that I have
not been too courageous&mdash;that I have satisfactorily done
what I set out to do.&nbsp; But I have passed my four-hundred and
fortieth page, and yet I seem to have let down only a
child&rsquo;s bucket into a sea of ideas that has no limit.&nbsp;
Out of scores upon scores of articles buried in many periodicals
I have been able to give three or four from the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um,&rsquo; none from the
&lsquo;Examiner,&rsquo; and none out of the &lsquo;Nineteenth
Century,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Fortnightly Review,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Harper&rsquo;s Magazine,&rsquo; etc.&nbsp; Still, I have
been able to show that a large proportion of Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s scattered writings preaches the same
peculiar doctrine in a ratiocinative form which in
&lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Coming of Love&rsquo; is
artistically enunciated; that this doctrine is of the greatest
importance at the present time, when science seems to be
revealing a system of the universe so deeply opposed to the
system which in the middle of the last century seemed to be
revealed; and that this doctrine of Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s is
making a very deep impression upon the generation to which I
belong.&nbsp; If it should be said that in speaking for the
younger generation I am speaking for a pigmy race (and I
sometimes fear that we are pigmies <a name="page443"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 443</span>when I remember the stature of our
fathers), I am content to appeal to one of the older generation,
who has spoken words in praise of Mr. Watts-Dunton as a poet,
which would demand even my courage to echo.&nbsp; I mean Dr.
Gordon Hake, whose volume of sonnets, entitled, &lsquo;The New
Day,&rsquo; was published in 1890.&nbsp; It was these remarkable
sonnets which moved Frank Groome to dub Mr. Watts-Dunton
&lsquo;homo ne quidem unius libri,&rsquo; a literary celebrity
who had not published a single book.&nbsp; I have already
referred to &lsquo;The New Day,&rsquo; but I have not given an
adequate account of this sonnet-sequence.&nbsp; In their nobility
of spirit, their exalted passion of friendship, their
single-souled purity of loyal-hearted love, I do not think they
have ever been surpassed.&nbsp; It is a fine proof of Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s genius for friendship that he should be able
unconsciously to enlink himself to the souls of his seniors, his
coevals and his juniors, and that there should be between him and
the men of three generations, equal links of equal
affection.&nbsp; But I must not lay stress on the whimsies of
chronology and the humours of the calendar, for all Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s friends are young, and the youngest of them,
Mr. George Meredith, is the oldest.&nbsp; The youthfulness of
&lsquo;The New Day&rsquo; makes it hard to believe that it was
written by a septuagenarian.&nbsp; The dedication is full of the
fine candour of a romantic boy:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To &lsquo;W. T. W.,&rsquo; the friend who
has gone with me through the study of Nature, accompanied me to
her loveliest places at home and in other lands, and shared with
me the reward she reserves for her ministers and interpreters, I
dedicate this book.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following sonnet on &lsquo;Friendship&rsquo; expresses a
very rare mood and a very high ideal:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page444"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
444</span>Friendship is love&rsquo;s full beauty unalloyed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With passion that may waste in selfishness,<br />
Fed only at the heart and never cloyed:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Such is our friendship ripened but to bless.<br />
It draws the arrow from the bleeding wound<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With cheery look that makes a winter bright;<br />
It saves the hope from falling to the ground,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And turns the restless pillow towards the light.<br
/>
To be another&rsquo;s in his dearest want,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At struggle with a thousand racking throes,<br />
When all the balm that Heaven itself can grant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that which friendship&rsquo;s soothing hand
bestows:<br />
How joyful to be joined in such a love,&mdash;<br />
We two,&mdash;may it portend the days above!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The volume consists of ninety-three sonnets of the same fine
order.&nbsp; Many English and American critics have highly
praised them, but not too highly.&nbsp; This venerable
&lsquo;parable poet&rsquo; did not belong to my generation.&nbsp;
Nor did he belong to Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s generation.&nbsp;
His day was the day before yesterday, and yet he wrote these
sonnets when he was past seventy, not to glorify himself, but to
glorify his friend.&nbsp; They are one long impassioned appeal to
that friend to come forward and take his place among his
peers.&nbsp; The indifference to fame of Theodore Watts is one of
the most bewildering enigmas of literature.&nbsp; I have already
quoted what Gordon Hake says about the man who when the
&lsquo;New Day&rsquo; was written had not published a single
book.</p>
<p>With regard to the unity binding together all Mr.
Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s writings, I can, at least, as I have shown
in the Introduction, speak with the authority of a careful
student of them.&nbsp; With the exception of the late Professor
Strong, who when &lsquo;The Coming of Love&rsquo; appeared, spoke
out so boldly upon this subject in &lsquo;Literature,&rsquo; <a
name="page445"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 445</span>I doubt if
anyone has studied those writings more carefully than I have; and
yet the difficulty of discovering the one or two quotable essays
which more than the others expound and amplify their central
doctrine has been so great that I am dubious as to whether, in
the press of my other work, I have achieved my aim as
satisfactorily as it would have been achieved by
another&mdash;especially by Professor Strong, had he not died
before he could write his promised essay upon the inner thought
of &lsquo;Aylwinism&rsquo; in the &lsquo;Cyclop&aelig;dia of
English Literature.&rsquo;&nbsp; But, even if I have failed
adequately to expound the gospel of &lsquo;Aylwinism,&rsquo; it
is undeniable that, since the publication of &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo;
(whether as a result of that publication or not), there has been
an amazing growth of what may be called the transcendental
cosmogony of &lsquo;Aylwinism.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Robertson Nicoll, discussing the latest edition of
&lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo;&mdash;the &lsquo;Arvon&rsquo; illustrated
edition&mdash;says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; was in type, the
author, getting alarmed at its great length, somewhat mercilessly
slashed into it to shorten it, and the more didactic parts of the
book went first.&nbsp; Now Mr. Watts-Dunton has restored one or
two of these excised passages, notably one in which he summarizes
his well-known views of the &lsquo;great Renascence of Wonder,
which set in in Europe at the close of the eighteenth century and
the beginning of the nineteenth.&rsquo;&nbsp; In one of these
passages he has anticipated and bettered Mr. Balfour&rsquo;s
speculations at the recent meeting of the British
Association.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Something like the same remark was made in the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; of September 3, 1904:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The writer has restored certain didactic
passages of <a name="page446"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
446</span>the story which were eliminated before the publication
of the book, owing to its great length.&nbsp; Though the teaching
of the book is complete without the restorations, it seems a pity
that they were ever struck out, because they appear to have
anticipated the striking remarks of Mr. Balfour at the British
Association the other day, to say nothing of the utterances of
certain scientific writers who have been discussing the
transcendental side of Nature.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The restorations to which Dr. Nicoll and &lsquo;The
Athen&aelig;um&rsquo; refer are excerpts from &lsquo;The Veiled
Queen,&rsquo; by Aylwin&rsquo;s father.&nbsp; The first of these
comes in at the conclusion of the chapter called &lsquo;The
Revolving Cage of Circumstance&rsquo; and runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The one important fact of the
twentieth century will be the growth and development of that
great Renascence of Wonder which set in in Europe at the close of
the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth.</p>
<p>The warring of the two impulses governing man&mdash;the
impulse of wonder and the impulse of acceptance&mdash;will occupy
all the energies of the next century.</p>
<p>The old impulse of wonder which came to the human race in its
infancy has to come back&mdash;has to triumph&mdash;before the
morning of the final emancipation of man can dawn.</p>
<p>But the wonder will be exercised in very different fields from
those in which it was exercised in the past.&nbsp; The
materialism, which at this moment seems to most thinkers
inseparable from the idea of evolution, will go.&nbsp; Against
their own intentions certain scientists are showing that the
spiritual force called life is the maker and not the creature of
organism&mdash;is a something outside the <a
name="page447"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 447</span>material
world, a something which uses the material world as a means of
phenomenal expression.</p>
<p>The materialist, with his primitive and confiding belief in
the testimony of the senses, is beginning to be left out in the
cold, when men like Sir W. R. Groves turn round on him and tell
him that &ldquo;the principle of all certitude&rdquo; is not and
cannot be the testimony of his own senses; that these senses,
indeed, are no absolute tests of phenomena at all; that probably
man is surrounded by beings he can neither see, feel, hear, nor
smell; and that, notwithstanding the excellence of his own eyes,
ears, and nose, the universe the materialist is mapping out so
deftly is, and must be, monophysical, lightless, colourless,
soundless&mdash;a phantasmagoric show&mdash;a deceptive series of
undulations, which become colour, or sound, or what not,
according to the organism upon which they fall.&rsquo;</p>
<p>These words were followed by a sequence of mystical sonnets
about &lsquo;the Omnipotence of Love,&rsquo; which showed, beyond
doubt, that if my father was not a scientific thinker, he was, at
least, a very original poet.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second restored excerpt from &lsquo;The Veiled
Queen&rsquo; comes in at the end of the chapter called &lsquo;The
Magic of Snowdon,&rsquo; and runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I think, indeed, that I had passed into
that sufistic ecstasy expressed by a writer often quoted by my
father, an Oriental writer, Ferridoddin:&mdash;</p>
<p>With love I burn: the centre is within me;<br />
While in a circle everywhere around me<br />
Its Wonder lies&mdash;</p>
<p>that exalted mood, I mean, described in the great chapter on
the Renascence of Wonder which forms the very core and
heart-thought of the strange book so strangely destined <a
name="page448"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 448</span>to govern
the entire drama of my life, &lsquo;The Veiled Queen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The very words of the opening of that chapter came to me:</p>
<p>&lsquo;The omnipotence of love&mdash;its power of knitting
together the entire universe&mdash;is, of course, best understood
by the Oriental mind.&nbsp; Just after the loss of my dear wife I
wrote the following poem called &ldquo;The Bedouin Child,&rdquo;
dealing with the strange feeling among the Bedouins about girl
children, and I translated it into Arabic.&nbsp; Among these
Bedouins a father in enumerating his children never counts his
daughters, because a daughter is considered a disgrace.</p>
<p>Ily&agrave;s the prophet, lingering &rsquo;neath the moon,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Heard from a tent a child&rsquo;s heart-withering
wail,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Mixt with the message of the nightingale,<br />
And, entering, found, sunk in mysterious swoon,<br />
A little maiden dreaming there alone.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She babbled of her father sitting pale<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Neath wings of Death&mdash;&rsquo;mid sights
of sorrow and bale,<br />
And pleaded for his life in piteous tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor child, plead on,&rdquo; the succouring prophet
saith,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While she, with eager lips, like one who tries<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To kiss a dream, stretches her arms and cries<br />
To Heaven for help&mdash;&ldquo;Plead on; such pure
love-breath,<br />
Reaching the throne, might stay the wings of Death<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That, in the Desert, fan thy father&rsquo;s
eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The drouth-slain camels lie on every hand;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Seven sons await the morning vultures&rsquo;
claws;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Mid empty water-skins and camel maws<br />
The father sits, the last of all the band.<br />
He mutters, drowsing o&rsquo;er the moonlit sand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Sleep fans my brow; sleep makes us all
pashas;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or, if the wings are Death&rsquo;s, why Azraeel
draws<br />
A childless father from an empty land.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page449"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
449</span>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; saith a Voice, &ldquo;the wind of
Azraeel&rsquo;s wings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A child&rsquo;s sweet breath has stilled: so God
decrees:&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A camel&rsquo;s bell comes tinkling on the
breeze,<br />
Filling the Bedouin&rsquo;s brain with bubble of springs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And scent of flowers and shadow of wavering
trees,<br />
Where, from a tent, a little maiden sings.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Between this reading of Nature, which makes her but
&ldquo;the superficial film&rdquo; of the immensity of God, and
that which finds a mystic heart of love and beauty beating within
the bosom of Nature herself, I know no real difference.&nbsp;
Sufism, in some form or another, could not possibly be confined
to Asia.&nbsp; The Greeks, though strangers to the mystic element
of that Beauty-worship which in Asia became afterwards Sufism,
could not have exhibited a passion for concrete beauty such as
theirs without feeling that, deeper than Tartarus, stronger than
Destiny and Death, the great heart of Nature is beating to the
tune of universal love and beauty.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With regard to the two sonnets quoted above, a great poet has
said that the method of depicting the power of love in them is
sublime.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Slave girl&rsquo;s Progress to
Paradise,&rsquo; however, is equally powerful and equally
original.&nbsp; The feeling in the &lsquo;Bedouin Child&rsquo;
and in &lsquo;The Slave Girl&rsquo;s Progress to Paradise&rsquo;
is exactly like that which inspires &lsquo;The Coming of
Love.&rsquo;&nbsp; When Percy sees Rhona&rsquo;s message in the
sunrise he exclaims:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>But now&mdash;not all the starry Virtues seven<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Seem strong as she, nor Time, nor Death, nor
Night.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And morning says, &lsquo;Love hath such godlike
might<br />
That if the sun, the moon, and all the stars,<br />
Nay, all the spheral spirits who guide their cars,<br />
Were quelled by doom, Love&rsquo;s high-creative leaven<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Could light new worlds.&rsquo;&nbsp; If, then, this
Lord of Fate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="page450"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
450</span>When death calls in the stars, can re-create,<br />
Is it a madman&rsquo;s dream that Love can show<br />
Rhona, my Rhona, in yon ruby glow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And build again my heaven?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same mystical faith in the power of love is passionately
affirmed in the words of &lsquo;The Spirit of the Sunrise,&rsquo;
addressed to the bereaved poet:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Though Love be mocked by Death&rsquo;s obscene
derision,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Love still is Nature&rsquo;s truth and Death her
lie;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet hard it is to see the dear flesh die,<br />
To taste the fell destroyer&rsquo;s crowning spite<br />
That blasts the soul with life&rsquo;s most cruel sight,<br />
Corruption&rsquo;s hand at work in Life&rsquo;s transition:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This sight was spared thee: thou shalt still
retain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her body&rsquo;s image pictured in thy brain;<br />
The flowers above her weave the only shroud<br />
Thine eye shall see: no stain of Death shall cloud<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rhona!&nbsp; Behold the
vision!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some may call this too mystical&mdash;some may dislike it on
other accounts&mdash;but few will dream of questioning its
absolute originality.</p>
<p>Let me now turn to those words of Mr. Balfour&rsquo;s to which
the passages quoted from &lsquo;The Veiled Queen&rsquo; have been
compared.&nbsp; In his presidential address to the British
Association, entitled, &lsquo;Reflections suggested by the New
Theory of Matter,&rsquo; he said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We claim to found all our scientific
opinions on experience: and the experience on which we found our
theories of the physical universe is our sense of perception of
that universe.&nbsp; That is experience; and in this region of
belief there is no other.&nbsp; Yet the conclusions which thus
profess to be entirely founded upon experience are to all
appearance fundamentally opposed to it; our knowledge <a
name="page451"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 451</span>of reality
is based upon illusion, and the very conceptions we use in
describing it to others, or in thinking of it ourselves, are
abstracted from anthropomorphic fancies, which science forbids us
to believe and nature compels us to employ.</p>
<p>Observe, then, that in order of logic sense perceptions supply
the premisses from which we draw all our knowledge of the
physical world.&nbsp; It is they which tell us there is a
physical world; it is on their authority that we learn its
character.&nbsp; But in order of causation they are effects due
(in part) to the constitution of our orders of sense.&nbsp; What
we see depends, not merely on what there is to be seen, but on
our eyes.&nbsp; What we hear depends, not merely on what there is
to hear, but on our ears.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I may mention here a curious instance of the way in which any
idea that is new is ridiculed, and of the way in which it is
afterwards accepted as a simple truth.&nbsp; One of the reviewers
of &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo; was much amused by the description of the
hero&rsquo;s emotions when he stood in the lower room of Mrs.
Gudgeon&rsquo;s cottage waiting to be confronted upstairs by
Winifred&rsquo;s corpse, stretched upon a squalid
mattress:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;At the sight of the squalid house in which
Winifred had lived and died I passed into a new world of
horror.&nbsp; Dead matter had become conscious, and for a second
or two it was not the human being before me, but the rusty iron,
the broken furniture, the great patches of brick and dirty mortar
where the plaster had fallen from the walls,&mdash;it was these
which seemed to have life&mdash;a terrible life&mdash;and to be
talking to me, telling me what I dared not listen to about the
triumph of evil over good.&nbsp; I knew that the woman was still
speaking, but for a time I heard no <a name="page452"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 452</span>sound&mdash;my senses could receive
no impressions save from the sinister eloquence of the dead and
yet living matter around me.&nbsp; Not an object there that did
not seem charged with the wicked message of the heartless
Fates.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Fancy,&rsquo; said the reviewer, &lsquo;any man out of
Bedlam feeling as if dead matter were alive!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Well, apart from the psychological subtlety of this passage,
our critic must have been startled by the declaration lately made
by a sane man of science, that there is no such thing as dead
matter&mdash;and that every particle of what is called dead
matter is alive and shedding an aura around it!</p>
<p>Had the mass of Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s scattered writings
been collected into volumes, or had a representative selection
from them been made, their unity as to central idea with his
imaginative work, and also the importance of that central idea,
would have been brought prominently forward, and then there would
have been no danger of his contribution to the latest
movement&mdash;the anti-materialistic movement&mdash;of English
thought and English feeling being left unrecognized.&nbsp; Lost
such teachings as his never could have been, for, as Minto said
years ago, their colour tinges a great deal of the literature of
our time.&nbsp; The influence of the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um,&rsquo; not only in England, but also in
America and on the Continent, was always very great&mdash;and
very great of course must have been the influence of the writer
who for a quarter of a century spoke in it with such
emphasis.&nbsp; Therefore, if Mr. Watts-Dunton had himself
collected or selected his essays, or if he had allowed any of his
friends to collect or select them, this book of mine would not
have been written, for more competent hands would have undertaken
the task.&nbsp; But a study of work which, originally <a
name="page453"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 453</span>issued in
fragments, now lies buried &lsquo;full fathom five&rsquo; in the
columns of various journals, could, I felt, be undertaken only by
a cadet of letters like myself.&nbsp; There are many of us
younger men who express views about Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s work
which startle at times those who are unfamiliar with it.&nbsp;
And I, coming forward for the moment as their spokesman, have
long had the desire to justify the faith that is in us, and in
the wide and still widening audience his imaginative work has
won.&nbsp; But I doubt if I should have undertaken it had I
realized the magnitude of the task.&nbsp; For it must be
remembered that the articles, called &lsquo;reviews,&rsquo; are
for the most part as unlike reviews as they can well be.&nbsp; No
matter what may have been the book placed at the head of the
article, it was used merely as an opportunity for the writer to
pour forth generalizations upon literature and life, or upon the
latest scientific speculations, or upon the latest reverie of
philosophy, in a stream, often a torrent, coruscating with
brilliancies, and alive with interwoven colours like that of the
river in the mountains of Kaf described in his birthday sonnet to
Tennyson.&nbsp; Take, for instance, that great essay on the
Psalms which I have used as the key-note of this study.&nbsp; The
book at the head of the review was not, as might have been
supposed, a discourse learned, or philosophical, or emotional,
upon the Psalms&mdash;but a little unpretentious metrical version
of the Psalms by Lord Lorne.&nbsp; Only a clear-sighted and
daring editor would have printed such an article as a
review.&nbsp; But I doubt if there ever was a more prescient
journalist than he who sat in the editorial chair at that
time.&nbsp; A man of scholarly accomplishments and literary
taste, he knew that an article such as this would be a huge
success; would resound through the world of letters.&nbsp; The
article, I believe, <a name="page454"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 454</span>was more talked about in literary
circles than any book that had come out during that month.</p>
<p>Again, take that definition of humour which I seized upon
(page 384) to illustrate my exposition of that wonderful
character in &lsquo;Aylwin&rsquo;&mdash;Mrs. Gudgeon, a
definition that seems, as one writer has said, to make all other
talk about humour cheap and jejune.&nbsp; It is in a review of an
extremely futile history of humour.&nbsp; Now let the reader
consider the difficult task before a writer in my
position&mdash;the task of searching for a few among the
innumerable half-remembered points of interest that turn up in
the most unexpected places.&nbsp; Of course, if the space
allotted to me by my publishers had been unlimited, and if my
time had been unlimited, I should have been able to give so large
a number of excerpts from the articles as to make my selection
really representative of what has been called the &ldquo;modern
Sufism of &lsquo;Aylwin.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; But in this regard
my publishers have already been as liberal and as patient as
possible.&nbsp; After all, the best, as well as the easiest way,
to show that &lsquo;Aylwin,&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Coming of
Love,&rsquo; are but the imaginative expression of a poetic
religion familiar to the readers of Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s
criticism for twenty-five years, is to quote an illuminating
passage upon the subject from one of the articles in the
&lsquo;Athen&aelig;um.&rsquo;&nbsp; Moreover, I shall thus escape
what I confess I dread&mdash;the sight of my own prose at the end
of my book in juxtaposition to the prose of a past master of
English style:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The time has not yet arrived for poetry to
utilize even the results of science; such results as are offered
to her are dust and ashes.&nbsp; Happily, however, nothing in
science is permanent save mathematics.&nbsp; As a great man <a
name="page455"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 455</span>of science
has said, &lsquo;everything is provisional.&rsquo;&nbsp; Dr.
Erasmus Darwin, following the science of his day, wrote a long
poem on the &lsquo;Loves of the Plants,&rsquo; by no means a
foolish poem, though it gave rise to the &lsquo;Loves of the
Triangles,&rsquo; and though his grandson afterwards discovered
that the plants do not love each other at all, but, on the
contrary, hate each other furiously&mdash;&lsquo;struggle for
life&rsquo; with each other, &lsquo;survive&rsquo; against each
other&mdash;just as though they were good men and
&lsquo;Christians.&rsquo;&nbsp; But if a poet were to set about
writing a poem on the &lsquo;Hates of the Plants,&rsquo; nothing
is more likely than that, before he could finish it, Mr. Darwin
will have discovered that the plants do love after all; just
as&mdash;after it was a settled thing that the red tooth and claw
did all the business of progression&mdash;he delighted us by
discovering that there was another factor which had done half the
work&mdash;the enormous and very proper admiration which the
females have had for the males from the very earliest forms
upwards.&nbsp; In such a case, the &lsquo;Hates of the
Plants&rsquo; would have become &lsquo;inadequate.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Already, indeed, there are faint signs of the physicists
beginning to find out that neither we nor the plants hate each
other quite so much as they thought, and that Nature is not quite
so bad as she seems.&nbsp; &lsquo;She is an &AElig;olian
harp,&rsquo; says Novalis, &lsquo;a musical instrument whose
tones are the re-echo of higher strings within us.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And after all there are higher strings within us just as real as
those which have caused us to &lsquo;survive,&rsquo; and poetry
is right in ignoring &lsquo;interpretations,&rsquo; and giving us
&lsquo;Earthly Paradises&rsquo; instead.&nbsp; She must wait, it
seems; or rather, if this aspiring &lsquo;century&rsquo; will
keep thrusting these unlovely results of science before her eyes,
she must treat them as the beautiful girl Kis&#257;gotam&#299;
treated the ugly pile of charcoal.&nbsp; A certain rich man woke
up one morning and found that all his enormous wealth was <a
name="page456"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 456</span>turned to a
huge heap of charcoal.&nbsp; A friend who called upon him in his
misery, suspecting how the case really stood, gave him certain
advice, which he thus acted upon.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Thuthe,
following his friend&rsquo;s instructions, spread some mats in
the bazaar, and, piling them upon a large heap of his property
which was turned into charcoal, pretended to be selling it.&nbsp;
Some people, seeing it, said, &ldquo;Why does he sell
charcoal?&rdquo;&nbsp; Just at this time a young girl, named
Kis&#257;gotam&#299;, who was worthy to be owner of the property,
and who, having lost both her parents, was in a wretched
condition, happened to come to the bazaar on some business.&nbsp;
When she saw the heap, she said, &ldquo;My lord Thuthe, all the
people sell clothes, tobacco, oil, honey, and treacle; how is it
that you pile up gold and silver for sale?&rdquo;&nbsp; The
Thuthe said, &ldquo;Madam, give me that gold and
silver.&rdquo;&nbsp; Kis&#257;gotam&#299;, taking up a handful of
it, brought it to him.&nbsp; What the young girl had in her hand
no sooner touched the Thuthe&rsquo;s hand than it became gold and
silver.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I cannot find a clearer note for the close of this book than
that which sounds in one of the latest and one of the finest of
Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s sonnets.&nbsp; It was composed on the
last night of the Nineteenth Century, a century which will be
associated with many of the dear friends Mr. Watts-Dunton has
lost, and, as I must think, associated also with himself.&nbsp;
The lines have a very special charm for me, because they show the
turn which the poet&rsquo;s noble optimism has taken; they show
that faith in my own generation which for so many years has
illumined his work, and which has endeared him to us all.&nbsp; I
wish I could be as hopeful as this nineteenth century poet with
regard to the poets who will carry the torch of <a
name="page457"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 457</span>imagination
and romance through the twentieth century; but whether or not
there are any poets among us who are destined to bring in the
Golden Fleece, it is good to see &lsquo;the Poet of the
Sunrise&rsquo; setting the trumpet of optimism to his lips, and
heralding so cheerily the coming of the new argonauts:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">THE ARGONAUTS OF THE

<p style="text-align: right">[In starlight, listening to the

roll<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or move right onward to some destined goal<br />

<p>Since Love&rsquo;s Star rose have nineteen hundred years<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Impeaching Earth&rsquo;s proud birth, the human
soul,<br />
That we, the bright-browed stars, grow dim with tears.</p>
<p>Did those dear poets you loved win Light&rsquo;s release?<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; What &lsquo;ship of Hope&rsquo; shall sail to such a

I see young heroes bring Light&rsquo;s &lsquo;Golden

countries the happiest possible &lsquo;Dukkeripen&rsquo; (i.e.
prophetic symbol of Natura Mystica) is a hand-shaped golden cloud
floating in the sky.&nbsp; It is singular that the same idea is
found among races entirely disconnected with them&mdash;the
Finns, for instance, with whom Ukko, the &lsquo;sky god,&rsquo;
or &lsquo;angel of the sunrise,&rsquo; was called the
&lsquo;golden king&rsquo; and &lsquo;leader of the clouds,&rsquo;
and his Golden Hand was more powerful than all the army of
Death.&nbsp; The &lsquo;Golden Hand&rsquo; is sometimes called
the Lover&rsquo;s Dukkeripen.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
